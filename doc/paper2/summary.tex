\section{Summary} \label{sec:summary} 
Tight constraints on the total mass of neutrinos, $\smnu$, can distinguish
between the `normal' and `inverted' neutrino mass hierarchies and reveal
particle physics beyond the Standard Model. The tightest constaints come from
measuring the impact of $\smnu$ on the expansion history and the growth of
cosmic structure in the Universe using cosmological observables, 
combinations of CMB with other cosmological probes. While cosmological probes
have the potential to measure $\smnu$ more precisely than laboratory
experiments in the future, constraints from upcoming ground-based CMB
experiments will be severely limited by the degeneracy between $\smnu$ and
$\tau$, the optical depth of reionization. 


Meanwhile, measuring the $\smnu$ imprint on the 3D clustering of galaxies
provides an auspicious and opportune avenue for improving $\smnu$ constraints. 
In the coming years, upcoming surveys such as DESI, PFS, Euclid, and the
Roman Space Telescope will probe unprecedented cosmic volumes with galaxy
redshifts. Furthermore, progress in modeling nonlinear structure formation in 
simulations with massive neutrinos combined new simulation-based approaches
like `emulation', now enable us to tractably exploit the accuarcy of $N$-body
simulations to analyze galaxy clustering. Together, these development present 
the opporunity to go beyond traditional perturbation theory methods, unlock the
information content in nonlinear clustering where the impact of $\smnu$ is
strongest, and tightly constrain $\smnu$ and other cosmological parameters. 


While parameter degenarcies (\eg~$\smnu$--$\sig8$ degeneracy) pose serious
limitations on constraining $\smnu$ with traditional two-point clustering 
statistics, in \cite{hahn2020}, the previous paper of the series, we
demonstrated that the bispectrum, the next higher-order statistic, breaks
these degeneracies and dramatically improves constraints. We also illustrated 
the substantial constraining power of the bispectrum in nonlinear regimes.
\cite{hahn2020}, however, focused on the redshift-space halo bispectrum while 
constraints on $\smnu$ will come from galaxy distributions. %Therefore, in this paper, we extend the \cite{hahn2020} forecasts to include a realistic and complete galaxy bias model. 

In this work, we extend the \cite{hahn2020} halo bispectrum forecasts to
include a realistic and complete galaxy bias model. With our eyes set on
simulation-based analyses, we use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) galaxy
bias framework and construct 195,000 galaxy mock catalogs from the \quij 
$N$-body simulations. Using these mocks, we present the total information
content and constraining power of the {\em redshift-space galaxy bispectrum} 
down to nonlinear regimes. More specifically, we find
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Bg$ substantial improves in cosmological parameter constraints ---
    especially $\smnu$ --- even after marginalizing over galaxy bias through
    the HOD parameters. Combining $\Pgl$ and $\Bg$ further improves
    cosmological parameter constraints by breaking several key parameter
    degeneracies. For $\kmax{=}0.5\hmpc$, $\Bg$ improves constraints on 
    $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ by 2.8, 3.1, 3.8, 4.2, 4.2, and 
    $4.7{\times}$ over power spectrum. For $\smnu$, we achieve $5.6\times$ 
    tighter constraints with $\Bg$.
    \item Even with priors from \planck, $\Bg$ significantly improves
    cosmological constraints. For $\kmax{=}0.5\hmpc$, including $\Bg$ 
    achieves 2.0, 2.1, 1.9, 1.2, 2.2, and $2.3\times$ tighter constraints on 
    $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, and $\smnu$ than with $\Pgl$ and \planck. 
    \item $\Bg$ has substantial constraining power on non-linear regime beyond
    $\kmax > 0.2\hmpc$. This is particularly valuable when we include
    \planck~priors since the constraining power of $\Pgl$ completely saturates for $\kmax \gtrsim
    0.12\hmpc$; while with $\Bg$, constraints improve out to $\kmax=0.5\hmpc$. 
    Even at mildly non-linear regimes ($\kmax\sim0.2\hmpc$), however, $\Bg$
    substantially improves constraints on cosmological parameters. 
\end{itemize}

Overall, our results clearly demonstrate the significant advantages of the
galaxy bispectrum for more precisely constraining cosmological parameters ---
especially $\smnu$. There are, however, a few caveats in our forecast. 
Fisher matrix forecasts assume that the posterior is approximately Gaussian and
can overestimate the constraints for highly non-elliptical or asymmetric
posteriors. We also do not consider realistic survey geometry, selection
effects, or super-sample covariance. Lastly, we include galaxy bias through the
standard \cite{zheng2007} HOD model. Although, this model is sufficient for 
a high luminosity galaxy sample that our fiducial HOD produces, for galaxy
samples of upcoming surveys additional effects such as assembly bias and
velocity biases will need to included. While these effects will impact the
constraining power of $\Bg$, they also impact the constraining power of
$\Pg$. Hence, we nonetheless expect significant improvements from including 
the galaxy bispectrum.

There is, in fact, room for more optimism. All the constraints we present in
this paper is for a $1 ({\rm Gpc}/h)^3$ box and for a galaxy sample with number
density $\bar{n}_g \sim 1.63\times 10^{-4}~h^3{\rm Gpc}^{-3}$. Upcoming surveys
will probe {\em vastly} larger cosmic volumes and with higher number densities.
For instance, PFS will probe $\sim 9~h^{-3}{\rm Gpc}^3$ with ${\sim}5\times$ 
$n_g$ at $z\sim1.3$~\citep{takada2014}; DESI will probe ${\sim}50~h^{-3}{\rm Gpc}^3$
and its Bright Galaxy Surey and LRG sample will have ${\sim}20$ and $3\times$ 
higher $n_g$, respectively~\citep{desicollaboration2016,ruiz-macias2020}. 
Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope, space-based surveys, will expand these 
volumes to higher redshifts. Constraints {\em roughly} scale as $\propto 1/\sqrt{V}$
with volume and higher $\bar{n}_g$ samples will achieve higher signal-to-noise. 
Based our results, this suggests that analyzing the galaxy bispectrum in 
upcoming surveys has the potential to tightly constrain $\smnu$ with unprecedented 
precision. 

Now that we have demonstrated the total information content and constraining
power of $\Bg$, in the following paper of this series we will address a major 
practical challenge for a $\Bg$ analysis --- its 
large dimensionality. We will present how data compression can be used to reduce 
the dimensionality and tractably estimate the covariance matrix in a $\Pgl$ and
$\Bg$ analysis using a simulation-based approach. Afterwards, we will conduct a 
fully simulation-based $\Pgl$ and $\Bg$ reanalysis of SDSS-III BOSS. The series
will ultimately culminate in extending this simulation-based $\Pgl$ and $\Bg$
analysis to constrain $\smnu$ using the DESI survey.

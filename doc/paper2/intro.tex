    \item Neutrino mass background: condensed version of paper 1 
    \item paragraph that transitions to why LSS neutrino mass measurement is important (condensed version of paper 1) 
    \item and on why the bispectrum: condensed version of paper1
    \item transition to a paragraph on the summary of paper1 results
    \item paragraph on others including galaxy bias for $\smnu$ constraints, but they're all in the 
    perturbation theory framework so none extend to nonlinear scales. In this paper we include galaxy 
    bias in a simulation-based approach with emulation and LFI in mind. We use HODs, which are 
    (a sentence on hods)

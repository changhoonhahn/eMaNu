\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
More than two decades ago, neutrino oscillation experiments discovered the lower
bound on the sum of neutrino masses ($\smnu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV) and confirmed
physics beyond the Standard Model~\citep{fukuda1998, forero2014, gonzalez-garcia2016}. 
Since then, experiments have sought to more precisely measure $\smnu$ in order
to distinguish between the `normal' and `inverted' neutrino mass hierarchy
scenarios and further reveal the physics of neutrinos. Upcoming laboratory 
experiments (\eg~double beta decay and tritium beta decay), however, will not
be sufficient to distinguish between the mass hierarchies~\citep{bonn2011, drexlin2013}.
Fortunately, complementary and more precise constraints on $\smnu$ can be
placed by measuring the effect of neutrinos on the expansion history and growth
of cosmic structure. 

In the early Universe, neutrinos are relativistic and contribute to the 
energy density of radiation. Later, as they become non-relativistic, 
they contribute to the energy density of matter. This transition affects 
the expansion history of the Universe and leaves imprints on the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectrum~\citep{lesgourgues2012,
lesgourgues2014}. Massive neutrinos also impact the growth of structure. 
While neutrino perturbations are indistinguishable from cold dark matter (CDM)
perturbations on large scales, on scales smaller than their free-streaming
scale, neutrinos do not contribute to the clustering and reduce the 
amplitude of the total matter power spectrum. They also reduce the growth 
rate of CDM perturbations at late times. This combined suppression of 
the small-scale matter power spectrum leaves measurable imprints 
on the CMB as well as large-scale structure~\citep[for further details see][]{lesgourgues2012, lesgourgues2014, gerbino2018}.

The tightest cosmological constraints on $\smnu$ currently come from 
combining CMB temperature and large angle polarization data from the 
\planck satellite with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and CMB lensing: 
$\smnu < 0.13$ eV~\citep{planckcollaboration2018}. Future improvements
will likely continue to come from combining CMB data on large scales 
with clustering/lensing data on small scales and low redshifts, where 
the suppression of power by neutrinos is strongest~\citep{brinckmann2019}. 
But they will heavily rely on a better determination of $\tau$, the optical
depth of reionization since CMB experiments measure the combined quantity $A_s
e^{-2\tau}$~\citep{allison2015, liu2016, archidiacono2017}.
Most upcoming CMB experiments, however, are ground-based (\eg~CMB-S4) and 
will not directly constrain $\tau$~\citep{abazajian2016}. Meanwhile, proposed
future space-based experiments such as
LiteBIRD\footnote{http://litebird.jp/eng/} and 
LiteCOrE\footnote{http://www.core-mission.org/}, which have the greatest 
potential to precisely measure $\tau$, have yet to be confirmed. 

Despite the limited progress we can expect on constraining $\tau$ in the
near future, measuring the imprint of $\smnu$ on the 3D clustering of galaxies
provides a promising avenue for improving $\smnu$ constraints. With the
unprecedented cosmic volumes they will probe, upcoming galaxy surveys 
such as DESI\footnote{https://www.desi.lbl.gov/}, PFS\footnote{https://pfs.ipmu.jp/}, 
EUCLID\footnote{http://sci.esa.int/euclid/}, and WFIRST\footnote{https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/} 
have the potential to tightly constrain $\smnu$~\citep{audren2013, font-ribera2014, petracca2016, sartoris2016, boyle2018}.
Constraining $\smnu$ from 3D galaxy clustering, however, faces two limiting
challenges: (1) accurate theoretical modeling beyond linear scales, for bias
tracers in redshift-space and (2) parameter degeneracies that limit the
constraining power of standard two-point clustering analyses. 

Regarding the former, simulations have made huge strides in accurately modeling 
nonlinear structure formation with massive neutrinos~\citep[\eg][]{brandbyge2008, 
villaescusa-navarro2013, castorina2015, adamek2017, emberson2017, banerjee2018, 
villaescusa-navarro2018, villaescusa-navarro2019}. Moreover, new simulation-based
approaches, such as `emulation', enable us to tractably exploit the accuracy of 
$N$-body simulations and analyze galaxy clustering on nonlinear scales beyond
traditional perturbation theory methods. A nubmer of recent works have applied
these simulation-based approaches to analyze small-scale galaxy clustering with
remarkable success~\citep[\eg][]{heitmann2009, kwan2015, euclidcollaboration2018, lange2019, zhai2019, wibking2019}. 
These developments present the opportunity to significantly improve $\smnu$
constraints by unlocking the information content in nonlinear clustering, where
the impact of massive neutrinos is strongest~\citep[\eg][]{brandbyge2008,
saito2008, wong2008, saito2009, viel2010, agarwal2011, marulli2011, bird2012,
castorina2015, banerjee2016, upadhye2016}.

\cite{villaescusa-navarro2018} recently used more than 1000 $N$-body simulations from
the {\sc Hades} suite to examine the redshift-space matter and halo power spectrum. 
They found that the imprint of $\smnu$ and $\sig$ on the redshift-space halo power
spectrum are degenerate and differ by $< 1\%$. This $\smnu$ -- $\sig$ degeneracy poses 
a serious limitation on constraining $\smnu$ with the power spectrum. However,
information in the nonlinear regime cascades from the power spectrum to
higher-order statistics --- \eg~the bispectrum. More importantly, these
higher-order statistics help break the $\smnu$--$\sig$
degeneracy~\citep{hahn2020}. A number of studies have already demonstrated the potential of the bispectrum for improving cosmological
parameter constraints~\citep{sefusatti2005, sefusatti2006, chan2017, yankelevich2019}. 
\cite{chudaykin2019}, in particular, included $\smnu$ in their forecast and
found that the bispectrum significantly improves constraints on $\smnu$.
However, their perturbation theory based forecast does not include the
constraining power on nonlinear scales. 

In \cite{hahn2020}, the previous paper of this series, we used 22,000 $N$-body
simulations from the \quij suite to quantify the total information content and
constraining power of the redshift-space halo bispectrum down to nonlinear scales. 
For $k_{\rm max}{=}0.5~\mpc$, we found that the bispectrum produces $\Om$,
$\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ constraints 1.9, 2.6, 3.1, 3.6, and 2.6 times
tighter than the power spectrum. For $\smnu$, the bispectrum improves
constraints by 5 times over the power spectrum. While the forecasts marginalized 
over linear bias and halo mass limit parameters, and found that the
improvements of the bispectrum are not impacted when quadratic and nonlocal
bias parameters also included, the \cite{hahn2020} forecast focus on the halo
bispectrum. Constraints on $\smnu$ will ultimately be derived from the distribution 
of galaxies and, thus, a more realistic and complete galaxy bias model must be
incorporated to forecast $\smnu$ and other cosmological parameter constraints 
for the galaxy bispectrum.

In this work, we quantify the total information content and constraining power
of the {\em redshift-space galaxy bispectrum} down to $k_{\rm max}= 0.5~\hmpc$. For our galaxy
bias model, we use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework, which provides a
statistical prescription for populating dark matter halos with central and satellite
galaxies and has been remarkably successful in reproducing the observed galaxy
clustering~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{zheng2005, leauthaud2012, tinker2013, zentner2016, vakili2019}. 
Moreover, the HOD is the primary framework used in simulation-based clustering
analyses~\citep[\eg][]{mcclintock2018, zhai2019, lange2019, wibking2019}. 
We use Fisher forecasts calculated using $195,000$ galaxy mock catalogs derived
from $N$-body simulations and present the constraining power of the galaxy
bispectrum on $\smnu$ and other cosmological parameters after marginalizing 
over the HOD parameters. This work is the second paper in a series that aims 
to demonstrate the potential for simulation-based galaxy bispectrum analyses 
in constraining $\smnu$. Later in the series, we will also present methods to
tackle challenges that come with analyzing the full galaxy bispectrum, such 
as data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the bispectrum. The series 
will culminate in fully simulation-based $\Pgl$ and $\Bg$ reanalysis of SDSS-III BOSS. 

In Sections~\ref{sec:sims} and~\ref{sec:hod}, we describe the \quij $N$-body simulation 
suites the HOD framework we use to construct galaxy mock catalogs from them. We then 
describe in Section~\ref{sec:methods}, how we measure the bispectrum of these
simulations and calculate the Fisher forecasts of cosmological parameters. Finally, in
Section~\ref{sec:results}, we present the full information content of the
galaxy bispectrum and demonstrate how the bispectrum significantly improves 
the constraints on the cosmological parameters: $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, and {\em especially} $\smnu$.

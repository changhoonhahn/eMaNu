\section{Results} \label{sec:results} 
We present the Fisher matrix constraints for $\smnu$ and other cosmological
parameters from the redshift-space galaxy $\Pgl$ (blue), $\Bg$ (green), and 
combined $\Pgl + \Bg$ (orange) in Figure~\ref{fig:forecast}. These
constraints marginalize over the \cite{zheng2007} HOD parameters %$\{M_{\rm min}, \sigma_{\log M}, \log M_0, \alpha \log M_1 \}$ 
(bottom panels) and extends to $k_{\rm max} = 0.5\hmpc$. The contours mark the $68\%$ and
$95\%$ confidence intervals. With the redshift-space $\Pgl$
alone, we derive the following $1\sigma$ constraints for $\{\Om, \Ob, h, n_s,
\sig, \smnu\}$: 
\ch{0.03443, 0.01219, 0.14069, 0.16552, 0.07701, 0.58119}
With the redshift-space $\Bg$ alone, we get: 
\ch{0.01422, 0.00371, 0.03409, 0.03543, 0.02494, 0.10599}.
{\em The galaxy bispectrum substantially improves the constraints
on all cosmological parameters over the power spectrum.} 

With $\Pgl$ and $\Bg$, we derive even better constraints by breaking a number
of parameter degeneracies. Among the cosmological parameters, the $\Om-\sig$ 
degeneracy is broken and leads to significant improvements in both $\Om$ and 
$\sig$ constraints. Meanwhile, for the HOD parameters, degeneracies with 
$\log M_0$, $\alpha$, and $\log M_1$ are substantially reduced. 
Combining $\Pgl$ and $\Bg$, we get the following $1\sigma$ constraints for 
 $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, and $\smnu$: 
 \ch{0.01033, 0.00336, 0.03150, 0.03361, 0.01641, and 0.10299}
{\em With $\Pgl$ and $\Bg$ combined, we improve $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$,
$n_s$, and $\sig$ constraints by factors of \ch{3.3, 3.6, 4.5, 4.9, and 4.7}
and $\smnu$ constraint by a factor of 5.6.}

In Figure~\ref{fig:kmax_forecast}, we present the marginalized $1\sigma$
constraints, $\sigma_\theta(\kmax)$, of the cosmological parameters $\Om$,
$\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, and $\smnu$ as a function of $\kmax$ for $\Pgl$
(blue) and the combined $\Pgl + \Bg$ (orange). Again, these constraints are
marginalized over the \cite{zheng2007} HOD parameters (Eq.~\ref{eq:hod_fid}). 
For both $\Pgl$ and $\Pgl + \Bg$, parameter constraints improve at higher
$\kmax$. More importantly, {\em the galaxy bispectrum significantly 
improves constraints on all cosmological parameters throughout the $\kmax$
range and not only at high $\kmax$}. Even for $\kmax\sim 0.2\hmpc$, including 
$\Bg$ improves $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$ and $\smnu$ constraints by 
factors of 
\ch{2.6, 2.4, 2.7, 3.2, 4.1, and 3.6}.

We also present $\sigma_\theta(\kmax)$ for $\Pgl$ (blue dashed) and $\Pgl + \Bg$ 
(orange dashed) {\em with priors from \planck}. Once we include \planck priors,
$\Pgl$ constraints do not improve for $\kmax \gtrsim 0.12\hmpc$. However, the 
constraining power of $\Pgl + \Bg$ continues to increase for $\kmax > 0.15\hmpc$. 
At $\kmax=0.2\hmpc$, $\Bg$ improves the $\Pgl$ + \planck priors constraints on  
$\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$ and $\smnu$ constraint by factors of
\ch{1.5, 1.4, 1.4, 1.1, 1.3, and $1.4\times$}.
At $\kmax = 0.5\hmpc$, $\Bg$ improves the $\Pgl$ + \planck priors constraints on  
$\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$ and $\smnu$ constraint by factors of 
\ch{2.1, 2.1, 2.0, 1.2, 2.2, and $2.2\times$} 
Even with \planck priors, the galaxy bispectrum significantly improves cosmological 
constraints. In fact, we emphasize that the constraints in Figure~\ref{fig:kmax_forecast} 
are for a $1~({\rm Gpc}/h)^3$ box. Hence, they {\em underestimate} the 
constraining power contribution from galaxy clustering that we expect from upcoming
galaxy redshift surveys, which will probe a much larger volume (\emph{e.g.} DESI, Euclid). 
With more constraining power coming from galaxy clustering, improvements from
including $\Bg$ to $\Pgl$ and \planck will be larger.

In the previous paper of the series, \cite{hahn2020} presents the full
information content of the redshift-space halo bispectrum, $\Bh$. For $\Bh$ to
$\kmax=0.5\hmpc$, \cite{hahn2020} find $1\sigma$ constraints of 0.012, 0.004,
0.04, 0.036, 0.014, and 0.057 for $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$ and $\smnu$. 
In comparison, we find that $\Bg$ produces comparable constraints for $\Ob$, 
$h$, and $n_s$. On the other hand, $\Bg$ has less constraining power than 
$\Bh$ for $\Om$, $\sig$, and $\smnu$. This is the same for $\kmax=0.2\hmpc$. 
When we compare the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of $\Bg$ and $\Bh$, estimated 
from the covariance matrix~\citep[\eg][]{sefusatti2005,sefusatti2006,chan2017}, 
we find lower SNR for $\Bg$, consistent with the constraints. We also find that 
the increase in SNR with $\kmax$ is lessened for $\Bg$. This demonstrates that 
marginalizing over HOD parameters reduces some of the constraining power of 
$\Bg$.  Fingers-of-god (FoG), also contributes to this reduction. 
\ch{elaborate on how FoG}.
Nevertheless, $\Bg$ significantly improves parameters constraints over $\Pgl$.
In fact, marginalizing over HOD parameters and FoG reduces the constraining
power of the power spectrum more so than the bispectrum. Therefore, we find 
larger improvements in the parameter constraints from $\Bg$ over $\Pgl$ than
from $\Bh$ over $\Phl$.

%comparison to the literature.
%a number of previous works have quantified the infor- mation content of the bispectrum (Scoccimarro et al. 2004; Sefusatti et al. 2006; Sefusatti & Komatsu 2007; Song et al. 2015; Tellarini et al. 2016; Yamauchi et al. 2017; Karagiannis et al. 2018; Yankele- vich & Porciani 2019; Chudaykin & Ivanov 2019; Coulton et al. 2019; Reischke et al. 2019)
A number of previous works have quantified the information content of the
bispectrum:~\citep[\eg][]{scoccimarro2004, sefusatti2006, sefusatti2007,
song2015, tellarini2016, yamauchi2017a, karagiannis2018, yankelevich2019,
chudaykin2019, coulton2019, reischke2019}. 
We, however, focus our comparison to \cite{sefusatti2006}, \cite{yankelevich2019}, 
and \cite{chudaykin2019}, which provide bispectrum forecasts for full sets of
cosmological parameters.
\cite{sefusatti2006} present \lcdm forecasts for a joint likelihood analysis of
$\Bg$ with $\Pg$ and WMAP. For $\kmax = 0.2\hmpc$, they find that including
$\Bg$ improves constraints on $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ by 1.6, 1.2,
1.5, 1.4, and 1.5 times from the $\Pg$ and WMAP constraints. In comparison, for 
$\kmax = 0.2\hmpc$ and with \planck priors, we find $\Bg$ improves constraints
by  1.5, 1.4, 1.4, 1.1, and $1.3\times$, which is in agreement with
\cite{sefusatti2006}. We note, however, that there are
some significant differences in our analyses. First, \cite{sefusatti2006} uses 
the WMAP likelihood while we use priors from \planck. Furthermore, 
in our simulation-based approach, we marginalizes over the HOD parameters. On
the other hand, \cite{sefusatti2006} use a perturbation theory approach and 
marginalize over the linear and quadratic bias terms ($b_1, b_2$). 
Nevertheless, the improvement \cite{sefusatti2006} find in parameter constraints 
including $\Bg$ is in good agreement with our results. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Compare to PT papers with bias models. 
    \item a discussion on the impact of off diagonal terms of the covariance matrix. 
\end{itemize} 

% caveats paragraph 
We derive, for the first time, the total information cotent of the redshift-space 
galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum. Our simulation based approach, allows us
to go beyond previous perturbation theory approaches and accurately quantify the 
constraining power in the nonlinear regime. They, however, rely on the
stability and convergence of our covariance matrix and numerical derivatives.  
For our constraints we use $195000$ galaxy catalogs (Section~\ref{sec:hod}): 
$15,000$ for the covariance matrices and $180,000$ for the derivatives with 
respect to 11 parameters. To ensure that our results are robust, we conduct the
same set of convergence tests as \cite{hahn2020}. 

First, we test whether our results have sufficiently converged by deriving our 
constraints using different numbers of galaxy catalogs to estimate the covariance 
matrix and derivatives: $N_{\rm cov}$ and $N_{\rm deriv}$. For $N_{\rm cov}$,
we find $< XXXX\%$ variation $\sigma_\theta$ for $N_{\rm cov} > 12000$.
For $N_{\rm deriv}$, 
we find $< XXXX\%$ variation $\sigma_\theta$ for $N_{\rm cov} > 12000$.
vary by $< 10\%$, we conclude that the conergence of the covariance matrix or
deriviatves do not significantly impact our forecast. 
\ch{fill this in once we have the convergence test}. 

We evaluate the $\Pgl$ and $\Bg$ derivatives with respect to $\smnu$ using
simulations at the $\{\theta_{\rm ZA}, \smnu^+, \smnu^{++}, \smnu^{+++}\}$
cosmologies. To test the stability of the $\smnu$ derivatives, we compare
parameter constraints derived using two different sets of cosmologies: 
$\{\theta_{\rm ZA}, \smnu^+\}$ and $\{\theta_{\rm ZA}, \smnu^+\}$. 
\ch{check this once the multiple HOD seeds finish} 

% usual Fisher Forecast caveat  
Besides their convergence and stability, our forecasts are derived from Fisher
matrices. We, therefore, assume that the posterior is approximately Gaussian. 
When posteriors are highly non-elliptical or asymmetric, Fisher forecasts 
significantly underestimate the constraints~\citep{wolz2012}. We note that in
this paper we do not derive actual parameter constraints. Instead, we focus on
quantifying the information content and constraining power of $\Bg$ relative to
$\Pgl$. Hence, we do not explore beyond the Fisher forecast. In a later paper of 
the series, when we analyze the SDSS-III BOSS data using a simulation-based 
approach, we will use a robust method to sample the posterior.  

\ch{anything else that could be wrong that we've checked?} 


\ch{what's missing in the analysis: all the graints of salt/ future works}
\begin{itemize}
    \item how do the unrealistic hod parameters we use map onto real galaxy
        samples. We tried our best to get the SDSS-like sample. The main
        ``unrealistic'' parameter choice is $\sigma_{\log M}$ --- use the
        high resolution simulations to compare the derivative w.r.t sigma logM
        and make some statements regarding this. \ch{appendix?}
    \item we use a simplistic HOD model which doesn't take into account
        assembly bias. Overview the impact of assembly bias in previous galaxy
        clustering results and discuss how it may analogously apply to our
        constraints.
    \item along this line, we do not consider baryonic effects. However recent
        papers that have looked into this find the impact only matters at very
        high k.  
    \item including some extra nuisance parameters doesn't do anything for
        cosmological constraints. We tried b1, Asn, Bsn. \ch{try b2, gamma2} 
    \item alcock pacinzsky effect
    \item no geometry obviously. repeat of how realistic geometry lowers the
        signal to noise. 
\end{itemize}

\ch{restatement and discusssion of key findings} 
The improvements of $\Bg$ come from breaking parameter degeneracies. 
Most noteably, $\Om$ and $\sig$ degeneracies are broken by
$\Pgl + \Bg$, which improves $\Om - \sig$, $\Om - \smnu$, $\sig-\smnu$ that we care about. 

A key part of the improvement from $\Bg$ comes from the degeneracies that are
broken among HOD parameters. 
Furthermore, including $\Bg$ allows us to break a number of degeneracies among
HOD parameters. This is interesting because there are many questions regarding
HOD parameters that are still up in the air. For instance, the impact and
importance of assembly bias, which can impact cosmological analyses. Moreover,
tighter constraints on the halo occupation in general allows us to better 
understand the galaxy-halo connection, which will improve our understanding of
galaxy formation and evolution. While we consider a relatively simplistic halo
occupation model, our results clearly demonstrate the advantages of
higher-order statistic bispectrum over the standard two-point statistics. 

what's next in the paper series 
\begin{itemize}
    \item data compression 
    \item outline the overall forward modeling approach that will culminate in
        an analysis of BOSS. 
    \item paragraph outline the obvious extensions to DESI and PFS with rough
        numbers

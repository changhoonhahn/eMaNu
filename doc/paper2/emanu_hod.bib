  abstract = {Some of the dark matter in the Universe is made up of massive neutrinos. Their impact on the formation of large scale structure can be used to determine their absolute mass scale from cosmology, but to this end accurate numerical simulations have to be developed. Due to their relativistic nature, neutrinos pose additional challenges when one tries to include them in N-body simulations that are traditionally based on Newtonian physics. Here we present the first numerical study of massive neutrinos that uses a fully relativistic approach. Our N-body code, gevolution, is based on a weak-field formulation of general relativity that naturally provides a self-consistent framework for relativistic particle species. This allows us to model neutrinos from first principles, without invoking any ad-hoc recipes. Our simulation suite comprises some of the largest neutrino simulations performed to date. We study the effect of massive neutrinos on the nonlinear power spectra and the halo mass function, focusing on the interesting mass range between 0.06 eV and 0.3 eV and including a case for an inverted mass hierarchy.},

The line-of-sight-dependent selection contributions we include here are known to exist in real galaxy samples. We determine the maximum wavenumber included in the analysis by requiring that the next-order corrections to the galaxy power spectrum or bispectrum, treated here at next-to-leading and leading order, respectively, produce shifts of \$\textbackslash lesssim 0.25\textbackslash sigma\$ on each of the six cosmological parameters. With the galaxy power spectrum alone, selection effects can deteriorate the constraints severely, especially on the linear growth rate. Adding the galaxy bispectrum helps break parameter degeneracies significantly. We find that a joint power spectrum-bispectrum analysis of a Euclid-like survey can still measure the linear growth rate to 10\% precision after complete marginalization over selection bias. We also discuss systematic parameter shifts arising from ignoring selection effects and/or other bias parameters, and emphasize that it is necessary to either control selection effects at the percent level or marginalize over them. We obtain similar results for the Roman Space Telescope and HETDEX.},

The current 1 {$\sigma$} uncertainty of {$\approx$}103 meV (Planck-2015 +BAO -15 ) will be improved by upcoming "Stage-3" (S3) CMB experiments (S 3 +BAO -15 : 44 meV ), then upcoming BAO measurements (S 3 +DESI : 22 meV ), and planned next-generation "Stage 4" (S4) CMB experiments (S 4 +DESI : 15 - 19 meV , depending on angular range). An improved optical depth measurement is important: the projected neutrino mass uncertainty increases to 26 meV if S4 is limited to {$\mathscr{l}\&$}gt;20 and combined with current large-scale polarization data. Looking beyond {$\Lambda$} CDM , including curvature uncertainty increases the forecast mass error by {$\approx$}50 \% for S 4 +DESI , and more than doubles the error with a two-parameter dark-energy equation of state. Complementary low-redshift probes including galaxy lensing will play a role in distinguishing between massive neutrinos and a departure from a w =-1 , flat geometry.},

We also use the WPH statistics with a maximum entropy model to statistically generate new 2D density fields that accurately reproduce the probability density function, the mean and standard deviation of the power spectrum, the bispectrum, and Minkowski functionals of the input density fields.

  abstract = {The total luminosity of satellite galaxies around a central galaxy,  L\$\_\{sat\}\$, is a powerful metric for probing dark matter halos. In this paper we use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to explore the relationship between L\$\_\{sat\}\$ and various observable galaxy properties for a sample of 117,966 central galaxies out to \$z = 0.15\$. At fixed stellar mass, every galaxy property we explore shows a correlation with L\$\_\{sat\}\$. This implies that dark matter halos play a possibly significant role in determining these secondary galaxy properties. We quantify these correlations by computing the mutual information between L\$\_\{sat\}\$ and secondary properties and explore how this mutual information varies as a function of stellar mass and when separating the sample into star-forming and quiescent central galaxies. We find that absolute r-band magnitude correlates more strongly with L\$\_\{sat\}\$ than stellar mass across all galaxy populations; and that effective radius, velocity dispersion, and S\'ersic index do so as well for star-forming and quiescent galaxies. L\$\_\{sat\}\$ is sensitive to both the mass of the host halo as well as the halo formation history, with younger halos having higher L\$\_\{sat\}\$. L\$\_\{sat\}\$ by itself cannot distinguish between these two effects, but measurements of galaxy large-scale environment can break this degeneracy. For star-forming central galaxies, we find that r\$\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_v\$, and S\'ersic index all correlate with large-scale density, implying that these halo age plays a role in determining these properties. For quiescent galaxies, we find that all secondary properties are independent of environment, implying that correlations with L\$\_\{sat\}\$ are driven only by halo mass. These results are a significant step forward in quantifying the full extent of the galaxy-halo connection, and present a new test of galaxy formation models.},

The new data will be able to constrain the neutrino mass sum with the best precision ever. In order to exploit the complementarity of the different redshift probes, a deep understanding of the physical effects driving the impact of massive neutrinos on CMB and large scale structures is required. The goal of this work is to describe these effects, assuming a summed neutrino mass close to its minimum allowed value. We find that parameter degeneracies can be removed by appropriate combinations, leading to robust and model independent constraints. A joint forecast of the sensitivity of Euclid and DESI surveys together with a CORE-like CMB experiment leads to a 1{$\sigma$} uncertainty of 14 meV on the summed neutrino mass. Finally the degeneracy between M\textsubscript{{$\nu$}} and the optical depth at reionization {$\tau$}\textsubscript{reio}, originating in the combination of CMB and low redshift galaxy probes, might be broken by future 21-cm surveys, thus further decreasing the uncertainty on M\textsubscript{{$\nu$}}. For instance, an independent determination of the optical depth with an accuracy of {$\sigma$}({$\tau$}\textsubscript{reio})=0.001 (which might be achievable, although this is subject to astrophysical uncertainties) would decrease the uncertainty down to {$\sigma$}(M\textsubscript{{$\nu$}})=12 meV.},

We consider two different galaxy surveys: a spectroscopic redshift survey and a cosmic shear survey. We make use of the Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) technique and assume two sets of theoretical errors. The first error is meant to account for uncertainties in the modelling of the effect of neutrinos on the non-linear galaxy power spectrum and we assume this error to be fully correlated in Fourier space. The second error is meant to parametrize the overall residual uncertainties in modelling the non-linear galaxy power spectrum at small scales, and is conservatively assumed to be uncorrelated and to increase with the ratio of a given scale to the scale of non-linearity. It hence increases with wavenumber and decreases with redshift. With these two assumptions for the errors and assuming further conservatively that the uncorrelated error rises above 2\% at k = 0.4 h/Mpc and z = 0.5, we find that a future Euclid-like cosmic shear/galaxy survey achieves a 1-{$\sigma$} error on M\textsubscript{{$\nu$}} close to 32 meV/25 meV, sufficient for detecting the total neutrino mass with good significance. If the residual uncorrelated errors indeed rises rapidly towards smaller scales in the non-linear regime as we have assumed here then the data on non-linear scales does not increase the sensitivity to the total neutrino mass. Assuming instead a ten times smaller theoretical error with the same scale dependence, the error on the total neutrino mass decreases moderately from {$\sigma$}(M\textsubscript{{$\nu$}}) = 18 meV to 14 meV when mildly non-linear scales with 0.1 h/Mpc \&lt; k \&lt; 0.6 h/Mpc are included in the analysis of the galaxy survey data.},

In this paper, we explore a set of new summary statistics -- the \$k\$-Nearest Neighbor Cumulative Distribution Functions (\$k\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\$-\$\{\textbackslash rm CDF\}\$). This is the empirical cumulative distribution function of distances from a set of volume-filling, Poisson distributed random points to the \$k\$--nearest data points, and is sensitive to all connected \$N\$--point correlations in the data. The \$k\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\$-\$\{\textbackslash rm CDF\}\$ can be used to measure counts in cell, void probability distributions and higher \$N\$--point correlation functions, all using the same formalism exploiting fast searches with spatial tree data structures. We demonstrate how it can be computed efficiently from various data sets - both discrete points, and the generalization for continuous fields. We use data from a large suite of \$N\$-body simulations to explore the sensitivity of this new statistic to various cosmological parameters, compared to the two-point correlation function, while using the same range of scales. We demonstrate that the use of \$k\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\$-\$\{\textbackslash rm CDF\}\$ improves the constraints on the cosmological parameters by more than a factor of \$2\$ when applied to the clustering of dark matter in the range of scales between \$10h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$ and \$40h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$. We also show that relative improvement is even greater when applied on the same scales to the clustering of halos in the simulations at a fixed number density, both in real space, as well as in redshift space. Since the \$k\{\textbackslash rm NN\}\$-\$\{\textbackslash rm CDF\}\$ are sensitive to all higher order connected correlation functions in the data, the gains over traditional two-point analyses are expected to grow as progressively smaller scales are included in the analysis of cosmological data.},

The response functions describe how the small-scale power spectrum reacts to long-wavelength perturbations and they can be efficiently measured with the separate universe technique by absorbing the effects of the long modes into a modified cosmology. Specifically, we focus on the total first-order matter power spectrum response to an isotropic density fluctuation R1(k, z), which is fully determined by the logarithmic derivative of the non-linear matter power spectrum dlnPm(k, z)/dlnk and the growth-only response function G1(k, z). We find that G1(k, z) is not affected by the baryonic physical processes in the simulations at redshifts z {$<$} 3 and on all scales probed (k {$\lessequivlnt$} 15 h Mpc-1; i.e. length scales {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.4 Mpc h\^\{-1\}). In practice, this implies that the power spectrum fully specifies the baryonic dependence of its response function. Assuming an idealized lensing survey set-up, we evaluate numerically the baryonic impact on the squeezed-lensing bispectrum and the lensing supersample power spectrum covariance, which are given in terms of responses. Our results show that these higher-order lensing statistics can display varying levels of sensitivity to baryonic effects compared to the power spectrum, with the squeezed bispectrum being the least sensitive. We also show that ignoring baryonic effects on lensing covariances slightly overestimates the error budget (and is therefore conservative from the point of view of parameter error bars) and likely has negligible impact on parameter biases in inference analyses.},

We then apply a simple five parameter HOD, which was fit to each simulation separately, to the corresponding dark matter-only simulations, and measure the same clustering statistics. We find that the halo mass function is shifted to lower masses in the hydrodynamic simulations, resulting in a galaxy number density that is too high when an HOD is applied to the dark matter-only simulation. However, the exact way in which baryons alter the mass function is remarkably different in the two simulations. After applying a correction to the halo mass function in each simulation, the HOD is able to accurately reproduce all clustering statistics for the high luminosity sample of galaxies. For the low luminosity sample, we find evidence that in addition to correcting the halo mass function, including spatial, velocity, and assembly bias parameters in the HOD is necessary to accurately reproduce clustering statistics.},

  abstract = {We have used a combination of high resolution cosmological N-body simulations and semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation to investigate the processes that determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in cold dark matter (CDM) models and its relation to the spatial distribution of dark matter. The galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency with which galaxies form in haloes of different mass. In small mass haloes, galaxy formation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes, whereas in large mass haloes, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of the gas. As a result, the mass-to-light ratio of haloes has a deep minimum at the halo mass, \textasciitilde 1012Msolar, associated with L* galaxies, where galaxy formation is most efficient. This dependence of galaxy formation efficiency on halo mass leads to a scale-dependent bias in the distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. On large scales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the bias in the distribution of massive haloes. On small scales, the correlation function is determined by the interplay between various effects including the spatial exclusion of dark matter haloes, the distribution function of the number of galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent, dynamical friction. Remarkably, these processes conspire to produce a correlation function in a flat, {$\Omega$}0=0.3, CDM model that is close to a power law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. This model agrees well with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the automated-plate measurement survey. On small scales, the model galaxies are less strongly clustered than the dark matter, whereas on large scales they trace the occupied haloes. Our clustering predictions are robust to changes in the parameters of the galaxy formation model, provided only those models which match the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function are considered.},

By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of P(N|M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of {$\xi$}g(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical and semianalytic models in reproducing this form is entirely nontrivial. Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion, and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias. We outline a strategy for determining the HOD empirically from redshift survey data. This method starts from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that cosmological and HOD parameters will have nondegenerate effects on galaxy clustering, so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical determinations of the HOD as a function of galaxy type from the Two-Degree Field (2dF) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation, insight into the origin of galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological models.},

We calculate and compare the HODs predicted by a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation of a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model (cold dark matter with a cosmological constant) and by a semianalytic galaxy formation model applied to the same cosmology. Although the two methods predict different galaxy mass functions, their HOD predictions for samples of the same space density agree remarkably well. In a sample defined by a baryonic mass threshold, the mean occupation function M exhibits a sharp cutoff at low halo masses, a slowly rising plateau in which climbs from 1 to 2 over nearly a decade in halo mass, and a more steeply rising high-occupancy regime at high halo mass. In the low-occupancy regime, the factorial moments and are well below the values of 2 and 3 expected for Poisson statistics, with important consequences for the small-scale behavior of the two- and three-point correlation functions. The HOD depends strongly on galaxy age, with high-mass halos populated mainly by old galaxies and low-mass halos by young galaxies. The distribution of galaxies within SPH halos supports the assumptions usually made in semianalytic calculations: the most massive galaxy lies close to the halo center and moves near the halo's mean velocity, while the remaining, satellite galaxies have the same radial profile and velocity dispersion as the dark matter. The mean occupation at fixed halo mass in the SPH simulation is independent of the halo's larger scale environment, supporting both the merger tree approach of the semianalytic method and the claim that the HOD provides a complete statistical characterization of galaxy bias. We discuss the connections between the predicted HODs and the galaxy formation physics incorporated in the SPH and semianalytic approaches. These predictions offer useful guidance to theoretical models of galaxy clustering, and they will be tested empirically by ongoing analyses of galaxy redshift surveys. By applying the HODs to a large-volume N-body simulation, we show that both methods predict slight departures from a power-law galaxy correlation function, similar to features detected in recent observational analyses.},

The maximal discrepancy occurs at {\~k} 1h Mpc\textsuperscript{-1}, and is at the level of 10 per cent of the total suppression. Most published constraints on neutrino masses based on HALOFIT are not affected, as they rely on data probing the matter power spectrum in the linear or mildly non-linear regime. However, predictions for future galaxy, Lyman {$\alpha$} forest and weak lensing surveys extending to more non-linear scales will benefit from the improved approximation to the non-linear matter power spectrum we provide. Our approximation reproduces the induced neutrino suppression over the targeted scales and redshifts significantly better.

For this purpose, the integral electron energy spectrum is measured close to the endpoint of molecular tritium beta decay. The endpoint, together with the neutrino mass, should be fitted from the KATRIN data as a free parameter. The right-handed couplings change the electron energy spectrum close to the endpoint, therefore they have some effect also to the precise neutrino mass determination. The statistical calculations show that, using the endpoint as a free parameter, the unaccounted right-handed couplings constrained by many beta decay experiments can change the fitted neutrino mass value, relative to the true neutrino mass, by not larger than about 5\textendash 10\%. Using, incorrectly, the endpoint as a fixed input parameter, the above change of the neutrino mass can be much larger, order of 100\%, and for some cases it can happen that for large true neutrino mass value the fitted neutrino mass squared is negative. Publications using fixed endpoint and presenting large right-handed coupling effects to the neutrino mass determination are not relevant for the KATRIN experiment.},

Massive neutrinos also change the structure growth rate and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum, which can be measured using redshift-space distortions (RSD). We use the Fisher matrix formalism to disentangle these information sources, to provide projected neutrino mass constraints from each of these probes alone and to determine how sensitive each is to the assumed cosmological model. We isolate the distinctive effect of neutrino free-streaming on the matter power spectrum and structure growth rate as a signal unique to massive neutrinos that can provide the most robust constraints, which are relatively insensitive to extensions to the cosmological model beyond {$\Lambda$}CDM . We also provide forecasted constraints using all of the information contained in the observed galaxy power spectrum combined, and show that these maximally optimistic constraints are primarily limited by the accuracy to which the optical depth of the cosmic microwave background, {$\tau$}, is known.},

  abstract = {Over the next decade, improvements in cosmological parameter constraints will be driven by surveys of large-scale structure. Its inherent non-linearity suggests that significant information will be embedded in higher correlations beyond the two-point function. Extracting this information is extremely challenging: it requires accurate theoretical modelling and significant computational resources to estimate the covariance matrix describing correlations between different Fourier configurations. We investigate whether it is possible to reduce the covariance matrix without significant loss of information by using a proxy that aggregates the bispectrum over a subset of Fourier configurations. Specifically, we study the constraints on \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM parameters from combining the power spectrum with (a) the modal bispectrum decomposition, (b) the line correlation function and (c) the integrated bispectrum. We forecast the error bars achievable on \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM parameters using these proxies in a future galaxy survey and compare them to those obtained from measurements of the Fourier bispectrum, including simple estimates of their degradation in the presence of shot noise. Our results demonstrate that the modal bispectrum performs as well as the Fourier bispectrum, even with considerably fewer modes than Fourier configurations. The line correlation function has good performance but does not match the modal bispectrum. The integrated bispectrum is comparatively insensitive to changes in the background cosmology. We find that adding bispectrum data can improve constraints on bias parameters and the normalization \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ by up to 5 compared to power spectrum measurements alone. For other parameters, improvements of up to \$\textbackslash sim\$ 20\% are possible. Finally, we use a range of theoretical models to explore how the sophistication required for realistic predictions varies with each proxy. (abridged)},

Even though the assumption of a Gaussian likelihood is motivated by the central limit theorem, we discuss that it leads to Fisher information content that violates the Cram\textbackslash 'er-Rao bound if used consistently, owing to independent but artificial information from the parameter-dependent covariance matrix. At any fixed multipole, this artificial term is shown to become dominant in the case of a large number of correlated fields. While the distribution of the estimators does indeed tend to a Gaussian with a large number of modes, it is shown, however, that its Fisher information content does not, in the sense that their covariance matrix never carries independent information content, precisely because of the non-Gaussian shape of the distribution. In this light, we discuss the use of parameter-dependent covariance matrices with Gaussian likelihoods for parameter inference from two-point statistics. As a rule of thumb, Gaussian likelihoods should always be used with a covariance matrix fixed in parameter space, since only this guarantees that conservative information content is assigned to the observables, and at the same time prevents biases appearing.},

In this work we focus, in the first place, on the analysis of nonlinear effects in CDM and neutrinos perturbations contributing to the total matter power spectrum. We show that most of the nonlinear evolution is generated exclusively by the CDM component. We therefore compare mildly nonlinear predictions from Eulerian Perturbation Theory (PT), and fully nonlinear prescriptions (HALOFIT) with the measurements obtained from the simulations. We find that accounting only for the nonlinear evolution of the CDM power spectrum allows to recover the total matter power spectrum with the same accuracy as the massless case. Indeed, we show that, the most recent version of the (HALOFIT) formula calibrated on {$\Lambda$}CDM simulations can be applied directly to the linear CDM power spectrum without requiring additional fitting parameters in the massive case. As a second step, we study the abundance and clustering properties of CDM halos, confirming that, in massive neutrino cosmologies, the proper definition of the halo bias should be made with respect to the cold rather than the total matter distribution, as recently shown in the literature. Here we extend these results to the redshift space, finding that, when accounting for massive neutrinos, an improper definition of the linear bias can lead to a systematic error of about 1-2 \% in the determination of the linear growth rate from anisotropic clustering. This result is quite important if we consider that future spectroscopic galaxy surveys, as e.g. Euclid, are expected to measure the linear growth-rate with statistical errors less than about 3 \% at zlesssim1.},

Using a large suite of simulations, we find that the non-Gaussianity in the covariance is significant already at mildly nonlinear scales. We compute the leading disconnected non-Gaussian correction to the matter bispectrum covariance using perturbation theory, and find that the corrections result in good agreement in the mildly nonlinear regime. The shot noise contribution to the halo power spectrum and bispectrum covariance is computed using the Poisson model, and the model yields decent agreement with simulation results. However, when the shot noise is estimated from the individual realization, which is usually done in reality, we find that the halo covariance is substantially reduced and gets close to the Gaussian covariance. This is because most of the non-Gaussianity in the covariance arises from the fluctuations in the Poisson shot noise. We use the measured non-Gaussian covariance to access the information content of the power spectrum and bispectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio, S/N, of the matter and halo power spectrum levels off in the mildly nonlinear regime, \$k \textbackslash sim 0.1 - 0.2 \textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\} h\^\{-1\}\$. In the nonlinear regime the S/N of the matter and halo bispectrum increases but much slower than the Gaussian results suggest. We find that both the S/N for power spectrum and bispectrum are overestimated by the Gaussian covariances, but the problem being much more serious for the bispectrum. Because the bispectrum is affected strongly by nonlinearity and shot noise, inclusion of the bispectrum only adds modest amount of S/N compared to that of the power spectrum.},

  abstract = {Subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) is a widely used method to connect galaxies with dark matter structures in numerical simulations. SHAM predictions agree remarkably well with observations, yet they still lack strong theoretical support. We examine the performance, implementation, and assumptions of SHAM using the `Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environment' (EAGLE) project simulations. We find that Vrelax, the highest value of the circular velocity attained by a subhalo while it satisfies a relaxation criterion, is the subhalo property that correlates most strongly with galaxy stellar mass (Mstar). Using this parameter in SHAM, we retrieve the real-space clustering of EAGLE to within our statistical uncertainties on scales greater than 2 Mpc for galaxies with 8.77 {$<$} log 10(Mstar[M{$\odot$}]) {$<$} 10.77. Conversely, clustering is overestimated by 30 per cent on scales below 2 Mpc for galaxies with 8.77 {$<$} log 10(Mstar[M{$\odot$}]) {$<$} 9.77 because SHAM slightly overpredicts the fraction of satellites in massive haloes compared to EAGLE. The agreement is even better in redshift space, where the clustering is recovered to within our statistical uncertainties for all masses and separations. Additionally, we analyse the dependence of galaxy clustering on properties other than halo mass, I.e. the assembly bias. We demonstrate assembly bias alters the clustering in EAGLE by 20 per cent and Vrelax captures its effect to within 15 per cent. We trace small differences in the clustering to the failure of SHAM as typically implemented, I.e. the Mstar assigned to a subhalo does not depend on (I) its host halo mass, (II) whether it is a central or a satellite. In EAGLE, we find that these assumptions are not completely satisfied.},

  abstract = {Accurate cosmology from upcoming weak lensing surveys relies on  knowledge of the total matter power spectrum at per cent level at scales k {$<$} 10 h Mpc-1, for which modelling the impact of baryonic physics is crucial. We compare measurements of the total matter power spectrum from the Horizon cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: a dark-matter-only run, one with full baryonic physics, and another lacking active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Baryons cause a suppression of power at k {$\simeq$} 10 h Mpc-1 of {$<$}15 per cent at z = 0, and an enhancement of a factor of a few at smaller scales due to the more efficient cooling and star formation. The results are sensitive to the presence of the highest mass haloes in the simulation and the distribution of dark matter is also impacted up to a few per cent. The redshift evolution of the effect is non-monotonic throughout z = 0-5 due to an interplay between AGN feedback and gas pressure, and the growth of structure. We investigate the effectiveness of an analytic `baryonic correction model' in describing our results. We require a different redshift evolution and propose an alternative fitting function with four free parameters that reproduces our results within 5\{\{ per cent\}\}. Compared to other simulations, we find the impact of baryonic processes on the total matter power spectrum to be smaller at z = 0. Correspondingly, our results suggest that AGN feedback is not strong enough in the simulation. Total matter power spectra from the Horizon simulations are made publicly available at https://www.horizon-simulation.org/catalogues.html.},

  abstract = {We present a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) forecast for the precision of neutrino mass and cosmological parameter measurements with a Euclid-like galaxy clustering survey. We use a complete perturbation theory model for the galaxy one-loop power spectrum and tree-level bispectrum, which includes bias, redshift space distortions, IR resummation for baryon acoustic oscillations and UV counterterms. The latter encapsulate various effects of short-scale dynamics which cannot be modeled within perturbation theory. Our MCMC procedure consistently computes the non-linear power spectra and bispectra as we scan over different cosmologies. The second ingredient of our approach is the theoretical error covariance which captures uncertainties due to higher-order non-linear corrections omitted in our model. Having specified characteristics of a Euclid-like spectroscopic survey, we generate and fit mock galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum likelihoods. Our results suggest that even under very agnostic assumptions about non-linearities and short-scale physics a future Euclid-like survey will be able to measure the sum of neutrino masses with a standard deviation of 28 meV. When combined with the most recent Planck likelihood, this uncertainty decreases to 19meV. Reducing the theoretical error on the bispectrum down to the two-loop level marginally tightens the bound to 17 meV.},

Utilizing the motions of satellite galaxies around isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions and derive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. At both epochs the velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host galaxy stellar mass, {$\sigma\sptilde$}M0.4+/-0.1*, while the relation between satellite velocity dispersion and host galaxy B-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from {$\sigma\sptilde$}L0.6+/-0.1B at z\textasciitilde 1 to {$\sigma\sptilde$}L0.4+/-0.1B at z\textasciitilde 0. The evolution in M200/M* from z\textasciitilde 1 to z\textasciitilde 0 displays a bimodality insofar as host galaxies with stellar mass below M*\textasciitilde 1011 h-1 Msolar maintain a constant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.5) while host galaxies above M*\textasciitilde 1011 h-1 Msolar experience a factor of 3.3+/-2.2 increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. This result can be easily understood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to form stars while star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched and the dark matter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale grow in accordance with {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological simulations. Host galaxies that are red in U-B color have larger satellite dispersions and hence reside on average in more massive halos than blue galaxies at both z\textasciitilde 1 and z\textasciitilde 0. The satellite population of host galaxies varies little between these epochs. The redshift and host galaxy stellar mass dependence of M200/M* agrees qualitatively with the Millennium Run semianalytic model of galaxy formation.},

We find that all models predict an assembly bias signal of different magnitude, redshift evolution, and dependence with selection criteria and number density. To model these non-trivial dependences, we propose an extension to the standard SHAM technique so it can include arbitrary amounts of assembly bias. We do this by preferentially selecting subhaloes with the same internal property but different \{\textbackslash it individual\} large-scale bias. We find that with this model, we can successfully reproduce the galaxy assembly bias signal in either \{\textbackslash sc SAGE\} or the \{\textbackslash sc TNG\}, for all redshifts and galaxy number densities.

We find that the primary effect of massive neutrinos is to suppress the amplitude of the bispectrum with limited effect on the bispectrum shape. The suppression of the bispectrum amplitude is a factor of two greater than the suppression of the small scale power-spectrum. For an LSST-like weak lensing survey that observes half of the sky with five tomographic redshift bins, we explore the constraining power of the bispectrum on three cosmological parameters: the sum of the neutrino mass {$\sum$} m\textsubscript{{$\nu$}}, the matter density {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m} and the amplitude of primordial fluctuations A\textsubscript{s}. Bispectrum measurements alone provide similar constraints to the power spectrum measurements and combining the two probes leads to significant improvements than using the latter alone.

This suggests that the large-scale clustering of rare objects may provide a sensitive probe of primordial nongaussianity.

Graphical comparisons of these open models with the observed galaxy distribution in a large redshift survey are made. It is concluded that a model with a cosmological density parameter omega equal to one is quite unacceptable if galaxies trace the mass distribution, and that models with omega of roughly two, while better, still do not provide a fully acceptable match with observation. Finally, a situation in which galaxy formation is suppressed except in sufficiently dense regions is modelled which leads to models which can agree with observation quite well even for omega equal to one.},

With thousands of subhaloes per object we can accurately measure their spatial clustering and velocity distribution functions and compare these with observational data. The substructure properties of galactic haloes closely resemble those of galaxy clusters with a small scatter in the mass and circular velocity functions. The velocity distribution function is non-Maxwellian and flat topped with a negative kurtosis of approximately -0.7. Within the virial radius the velocity bias b={$\sigma$}sub/{$\sigma$}DM\textasciitilde{} 1.12 +/- 0.04, increasing to b {$>$} 1.3 within the halo centres. Slow subhaloes are much less common, due to physical disruption by gravitational tides early in the merging history. This leads to a spatially antibiased subhalo distribution that is well fitted by a cored isothermal. Observations of cluster galaxies do not show such biases, which we interpret as a limitation of pure dark matter simulations - we estimate that we are missing half of the halo population, which has been destroyed by physical overmerging. High-resolution hydrodynamical simulations are required to study these issues further. If CDM is correct then the cluster galaxies must survive the tidal field, perhaps due to baryonic inflow during elliptical galaxy formation. Spirals can never exist near the cluster centres and the elliptical galaxies there will have little remaining dark matter. This implies that the morphology-density relation is set before the cluster forms, rather than a subsequent transformation of discs to S0s by virtue of the cluster environment.},

These consequences include the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) featuring acoustic peaks and polarization, the matter power spectrum with baryonic wiggles, and their detection via photometric galaxy surveys, redshift distortions, cluster abundances, and Modern Cosmology is the first book to explain in detail the structure of the acoustic peaks in the CMB, the E/B decomposition in polarization which may allow for detection of primordial gravity waves, and the modern analysis techniques used on increasingly large cosmological data sets. Readers will gain the tools needed to work in cosmology and learn how modern observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe.},

  abstract = {In this contribution, we review the status and perspectives of direct neutrino mass experiments, which investigate the kinematics of -decays of specific isotopes (3H, 187Re, 163Ho) to derive model-independent information on the averaged electron (anti)neutrino mass. After discussing the kinematics of -decay and the determination of the neutrino mass, we give a brief overview of past neutrino mass measurements (SN1987a-ToF studies, Mainz and Troitsk experiments for 3H, cryobolometers for 187Re). We then describe the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment currently under construction at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, which will use the MAC-E-Filter principle to push the sensitivity down to a value of 200 meV (90\% C.L.). To do so, many technological challenges have to be solved related to source intensity and stability, as well as precision energy analysis and low background rate close to the kinematic endpoint of tritium -decay at 18.6 keV. We then review new approaches such as the MARE, ECHO, and Project8 experiments, which offer the promise to perform an independent measurement of the neutrino mass in the sub-eV region. Altogether, the novel methods developed in direct neutrino mass experiments will provide vital information on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos.},

  abstract = {Constraining neutrino mass remains an elusive challenge in modern physics. Precision measurements are expected from several upcoming cosmological probes of large-scale structure. Achieving this goal relies on an equal level of precision from theoretical predictions of neutrino clustering. Numerical simulations of the non-linear evolution of cold dark matter and neutrinos play a pivotal role in this process. We incorporate neutrinos into the cosmological N-body code CUBEP\textsuperscript{3}M and discuss the challenges associated with pushing to the extreme scales demanded by the neutrino problem. We highlight code optimizations made to exploit modern high performance computing architectures and present a novel method of data compression that reduces the phase-space particle footprint from 24 bytes in single precision to roughly 9 bytes. We scale the neutrino problem to the Tianhe-2 supercomputer and provide details of our production run, named TianNu, which uses 86\% of the machine (13 824 compute nodes). With a total of 2.97 trillion particles, TianNu is currently the world's largest cosmological N-body simulation and improves upon previous neutrino simulations by two orders of magnitude in scale. We finish with a discussion of the unanticipated computational challenges that were encountered during the TianNu runtime.},

  abstract = {We present a new power spectrum emulator named EuclidEmulator that estimates the nonlinear correction to the linear dark matter power spectrum. It is based on a spectral decomposition method called polynomial chaos expansion. All steps in the construction of the emulator have been tested and optimized: the large high-resolution N-body simulations carried out with PKDGRAV3 were validated using a simulation from the Euclid Flagship campaign and demonstrated to have converged up to wavenumbers \$k\textbackslash approx 5\textbackslash,h\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ for redshifts \$z\textbackslash leq 5\$. The emulator is constructed using the uncertainty quantification software UQLab and it has been optimized first by creating mock emulators based on Takahashi's HALOFIT. We show that it is possible to successfully predict the performance of the final emulator in this way prior to performing any N-body simulations. We provide a C-code to calculate the nonlinear correction at a relative accuracy of \$\textbackslash sim0.3\textbackslash\%\$ with respect to N-body simulations within 50 ms. The absolute accuracy of the final nonlinear power spectrum is comparable to one obtained with N-body simulations, i.e. \$\textbackslash sim 1\textbackslash\%\$ for \$k\textbackslash lesssim 1\textbackslash,h\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$ and \$z\textbackslash lesssim 3.5\$. This enables efficient forward modeling in the nonlinear regime allowing for maximum likelihood estimation of cosmological parameters. EuclidEmulator has been compared to HALOFIT and CosmicEmu, an alternative emulator based on the Mira-Titan Universe, and shown to be more accurate than these other approaches. This work paves a new way for optimal construction of future emulators that also consider other cosmological observables, use higher resolution input simulations and investigate higher dimensional cosmological parameter spaces.},

We note that constraints on Dark Energy are significantly degraded by the presence of neutrino mass uncertainty, especially when using galaxy clustering only as a probe of the BAO distance scale (because this introduces additional uncertainty in the background evolution after the CMB epoch). Using broadband galaxy power becomes relatively more powerful, and bigger gains are achieved by combining lensing survey constraints with redshift survey constraints. We do not try to be especially innovative, e.g., with complex treatments of potential systematic errors \textemdash{} these projections are intended as a straightforward baseline for comparison to more detailed analyses.},

Modelling or mitigating this impact will be essential for making full use of upcoming measurements of cosmic shear and other large-scale structure probes. We study baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum, using measurements from a selection of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG, Illustris, EAGLE, and BAHAMAS. We identify a low-redshift enhancement of the bispectrum, peaking at \$k\textbackslash sim 3h\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\^\{-1\}\$, that is present in several simulations, and discuss how it can be associated to the evolving nature of AGN feedback at late times. This enhancement does not appear in the matter power spectrum, and therefore represents a new source of degeneracy breaking between two- and three-point statistics. In addition, we provide physical interpretations for other aspects of these measurements, and make initial comparisons to predictions from perturbation theory, empirical fitting formulas, and the response function formalism. We publicly release our measurements (including estimates of their uncertainty due to sample variance) and bispectrum measurement code as resources for the community.},

  abstract = {The redshift-space bispectrum (three point statistics) of galaxies  depends on the expansion rate, the growth rate and the geometry of the Universe, and hence can be used to measure key cosmological parameters. In a homogeneous Universe, the bispectrum is a function of five variables and unlike its two point statistics counterpart - the power spectrum - which is a function of only two variables - is difficult to analyse unless the information is somehow reduced. The most commonly considered reduction schemes rely on computing angular integrals over possible orientations of the bispectrum triangle, thus reducing it to sets of function of only three variables describing the triangle shape. We use Fisher information formalism to study the information loss associated with this angular integration. Without any reduction, the bispectrum alone can deliver constraints on the growth rate parameter f that are better by a factor of 2.5 compared with the power spectrum, for a sample of luminous red galaxies expected from near future galaxy surveys at a redshift of z \texttildelow{} 0.65 if we consider all the wavenumbers up to k {$\leq$} 0.2 h Mpc-1. At lower redshifts the improvement could be up to a factor of 3. We find that most of the information is in the azimuthal averages of the first three even multipoles. This suggests that the bispectrum of every configuration can be reduced to just three numbers (instead of a 2D function) without significant loss of cosmologically relevant information.},

We use a large cosmological simulation and a variety of high-resolution resimulations of individual cluster and galaxy haloes to study the systematics of subhalo populations over ranges of 1000 in halo mass and 1000 in the ratio of subhalo to parent halo mass. The subhalo populations of different haloes are not scaled copies of each other, but vary systematically with halo properties. On average, the amount of substructure increases with halo mass. At fixed mass, it decreases with halo concentration and with halo formation redshift. These trends are comparable in size to the scatter in subhalo abundance between similar haloes. Averaged over all haloes of given mass, the abundance of low-mass subhaloes per unit parent halo mass is independent of parent mass. It is very similar to the abundance per unit mass of low-mass haloes in the Universe as a whole, once differing boundary definitions for subhaloes and haloes are accounted for. The radial distribution of subhaloes within their parent haloes is substantially less centrally concentrated than that of the dark matter. It varies at most weakly with the mass (or concentration) of the parent halo and not at all with subhalo mass. It does depend on the criteria used to define the subhalo population considered. About 90 per cent of present-day subhaloes were accreted after z= 1 and about 70 per cent after z= 0.5. Only about 8 per cent of the total mass of all haloes accreted at z= 1 survives as bound subhaloes at z= 0. For haloes accreted at z= 2, the survival mass fraction is just 2 per cent. Subhaloes seen near the centre of their parent typically were accreted earlier and retain less of their original mass than those seen near the edge. These strong systematics mean that comparison with galaxies in real clusters is only possible if the formation of the luminous component is modelled appropriately.},

Both methods involve reducing the dimension of the original data vector (e.g. 1000 elements) to the number of cosmological parameters considered (e.g. seven ) using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve algorithm. In the first case, we run MCMC sampling on the compressed data vector in order to recover the 1D and 2D posterior distributions. The second option, approximately 2000 times faster, works by orthogonalizing the parameter space through diagonalization of the Fisher information matrix before the compression, obtaining the posterior distributions without the need of MCMC sampling. Using these methods for future spectroscopic redshift surveys like DESI, Euclid, and PFS would drastically reduce the number of simulations needed to compute accurate covariance matrices with minimal loss of constraining power. We consider a redshift bin of a DESI-like experiment. Using the power spectrum combined with the bispectrum as a data vector, both compression methods on average recover the 68 \{per cent\} credible regions to within 0.7 \{per cent\} and 2 \{per cent\} of those resulting from standard MCMC sampling, respectively.

In the first case, we infer the posterior through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from the likelihood of the compressed data vector (MC-KL). The second, faster option, works by first Gaussianizing and then orthogonalizing the parameter space before the compression; in this option (G-PCA) we only need to run a low-resolution preliminary MCMC sample for the Gaussianization to compute our posterior. Both compression methods accurately reproduce the posterior distributions obtained by standard MCMC sampling on the CMASS data set for a k-space range of 0.03-0.12 h Mpc\^\{-1\}. The compression enables us to increase the number of bispectrum measurements by a factor of{\~ }23 over the standard binning (from 116 to 2734 triangle bins used), which is otherwise limited by the number of mock catalogues available.

  abstract = {We present a novel method to compress galaxy clustering three-point statistics and apply it to redshift space galaxy bispectrum monopole measurements from BOSS DR12 CMASS data considering a \$k\$-space range of \$0.03-0.12\textbackslash,h/\textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\$. The method consists in binning together bispectra evaluated at sets of wave-numbers forming closed triangles with similar geometrical properties: the area, the cosine of the largest angle and the ratio between the cosines of the remaining two angles. This enables us to increase the number of bispectrum measurements for example by a factor of \$23\$ over the standard binning (from 116 to 2734 triangles used), which is otherwise limited by the number of mock catalogues available to estimate the covariance matrix needed to derive parameter constraints. The \$68\textbackslash\%\$ credible intervals for the inferred parameters \$\textbackslash left(b\_1,b\_2,f,\textbackslash sigma\_8\textbackslash right)\$ are thus reduced by \$\textbackslash left(-39\textbackslash\%,-49\textbackslash\%,-29\textbackslash\%,-22\textbackslash\%\textbackslash right)\$, respectively. We find very good agreement with the posteriors recently obtained by alternative maximal compression methods. This new method does not require the a-priori computation of the data-vector covariance matrix and has the potential to be directly applicable to other three-point statistics (e.g. glaxy clustering, weak gravitational lensing, 21 cm emission line) measured from future surveys such as DESI, Euclid, PFS and SKA.},

For a volume-limited luminous red galaxy sample in the redshift range of 0.48 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.55, we perform halo occupation distribution modelling of the small- and intermediate-scale (0.1-60 h-1 Mpc) projected and redshift-space two-point correlation functions, with an accurate model built on high-resolution N-body simulations. To interpret the measured redshift-space distortions, the distribution of galaxy velocities must differ from that of the dark matter inside haloes of {$\sim$}1013-1014 h-1 M{$\odot$}, i.e. the data require the existence of galaxy velocity bias. Most notably, central galaxies on average are not at rest with respect to the core of their host haloes, but rather move around it with a 1D velocity dispersion of 0.22\^\{+0.03\}\_\{-0.04\} times that of the dark matter, implying a spatial offset from the centre at the level of {$\lessequivlnt$}1 per cent of the halo virial radius. The luminous satellite galaxies move more slowly than the dark matter, with velocities 0.86\^\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.03\} times those of the dark matter, which suggests that the velocity and spatial distributions of these satellites cannot both be unbiased. The constraints mainly arise from the Fingers-of-God effect at non-linear scales and the smoothing to the Kaiser effect in the translinear regime; the robustness of the results is demonstrated by a variety of tests. We discuss the implications of the existence of galaxy velocity bias for investigations of galaxy formation and cosmology.},

We find a clear dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity in both projected and redshift spaces, generally being stronger for more luminous samples. The measurements are successfully interpreted within the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework with central and satellite velocity bias parameters to describe galaxy kinematics inside haloes and to model redshift-space distortion effects. In agreement with previous studies, we find that more luminous galaxies reside in more massive haloes. Including the redshift-space 2PCFs helps tighten the HOD constraints. Moreover, we find that luminous central galaxies are not at rest at the halo centres, with the velocity dispersion about 30 per cent that of the dark matter. Such a relative motion may reflect the consequence of galaxy and halo mergers, and we find that central galaxies in lower mass haloes tend to be more relaxed with respect to their host haloes. The motion of satellite galaxies in luminous samples is consistent with their following that of the dark matter. For faint samples, satellites tends to have slower motion, with velocity dispersion inside haloes about 85 per cent that of the dark matter. We discuss possible applications of the velocity bias constraints on studying galaxy evolution and cosmology. In the appendix, we characterize the distribution of galaxy redshift measurement errors, which is well described by a Gaussian-convolved double exponential distribution.},

By comparing the clustering of galaxies measured in the 300 Mpc TNG box (TNG300) with that predicted by the standard (basic) HOD model, we find that, on average, the `basic' HOD model underpredicts the real-space correlation function in the TNG300 box by {$\sim$}15 per cent on scales of 1 {$<$} r {$<$} 20 Mpc h\^\{-1\}, which is well beyond the target precision demanded of next-generation galaxy redshift surveys. We perform several tests to establish the robustness of our findings to systematic effects, including the effect of finite box size and the choice of halo finder. In our exploration of `secondary' parameters with which to augment the `basic' HOD, we find that the local environment of the halo, the velocity dispersion anisotropy, {$\beta$}, and the product of the half-mass radius and the velocity dispersion, {$\sigma$}2Rhalfmass, are the three most effective measures of assembly bias that help reconcile the `basic' HOD-predicted clustering with that in TNG300. In addition, we test other halo properties such as halo spin, formation epoch, and halo concentration. We also find that at fixed halo mass, galaxies in one type of environment cluster differently from galaxies in another. We demonstrate that a more complete model of the galaxy-halo connection can be constructed if we combine both mass and local environment information about the halo.},

  abstract = {Standard approaches to Bayesian parameter inference in large scale structure assume a Gaussian functional form (chi-squared form) for the likelihood. This assumption, in detail, cannot be correct. Likelihood free inferences such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) relax these restrictions and make inference possible without making any assumptions on the likelihood. Instead ABC relies on a forward generative model of the data and a metric for measuring the distance between the model and data. In this work, we demonstrate that ABC is feasible for LSS parameter inference by using it to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model for populating dark matter halos with galaxies. Using specific implementation of ABC supplemented with Population Monte Carlo importance sampling, a generative forward model using HOD, and a distance metric based on galaxy number density, two-point correlation function, and galaxy group multiplicity function, we constrain the HOD parameters of mock observation generated from selected "true" HOD parameters. The parameter constraints we obtain from ABC are consistent with the "true" HOD parameters, demonstrating that ABC can be reliably used for parameter inference in LSS. Furthermore, we compare our ABC constraints to constraints we obtain using a pseudo-likelihood function of Gaussian form with MCMC and find consistent HOD parameter constraints. Ultimately our results suggest that ABC can and should be applied in parameter inference for LSS analyses.},

  abstract = {We present constraints on the timescale of star formation variability and the correlation between star formation and host halo accretion histories of star-forming (SF) central galaxies from the scatter of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). SF galaxies are found to have a tight relationship between their star formation rates and stellar masses on the so-called "star-forming sequence" (SFS), which characterizes their SF histories and \$M\_*\$ growths. Meanwhile, observed SHMR constraints connect \$M\_*\$ growth to halo accretion history. Combining these observed trends with a cosmological \$N\$-body simulation, we present flexible models that track the SF, \$M\_*\$, and halo accretion histories of SF central galaxies at \$z{$<$}1\$ while reproducing the observed stellar mass function and SFS in SDSS DR7. We find that the scatter in SHMR at \$M\_h=10\^\{12\}M\_\textbackslash odot\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{M\_*|M\_h=10\^\{12\}M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$, is sensitive to the timescale of star formation variability, \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}\$, and the correlation coefficient, \$r\$, between SF and halo accretion histories: shorter \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}\$ and higher \$r\$ both result in tighter \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{M\_*|M\_h=10\^\{12\}M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$. To reproduce a constant 0.2 dex scatter over \$z=1-0\$, our models require \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}\textbackslash leq1.5\$ Gyr for \$r=0.99\$ or \$r{$>$}0.6\$ for \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}=0.1\$ Gyr. For \$r\textbackslash sim0.6\$, as found in the literature, \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}{$<$}0.2\$ Gyr is necessary. Meanwhile, to reproduce the tightening of \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{M\_*|M\_h=10\^\{12\}M\_\textbackslash odot\}=0.35\$ to 0.2 dex from \$z=1-0\$ in hydrodynamical simulations, our models require \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}=0.1\$ Gyr for \$r{$>$}0.5\$. Although, the lack of consensus on \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{M\_*|M\_h=10\^\{12\}M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$ at \$M\_h=10\^\{12\}M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and at \$z=1\$ from observations and galaxy formation models remains the main bottleneck in precisely constraining \$r\$ and \$t\_\{\textbackslash rm duty\}\$, we demonstrate that SHMR can be used to constrain the SF and host halo accretion histories of SF central galaxies.},

  abstract = {Massive neutrinos suppress the growth of structure below their free-streaming scale and leave an imprint on large-scale structure. Measuring this imprint allows us to constrain the sum of neutrino masses, M{$\nu$}, a key parameter in particle physics beyond the Standard Model. However, degeneracies among cosmological parameters, especially between M{$\nu$} and {$\sigma$}8, limit the constraining power of standard two-point clustering statistics. In this work, we investigate whether we can break these degeneracies and constrain M{$\nu$} with the next higher-order correlation function\textemdash the bispectrum. We first examine the redshift-space halo bispectrum of 800 N-body simulations from the HADES suite and demonstrate that the bispectrum helps break the M{$\nu$}-{$\sigma$}8 degeneracy. Then using 22,000 N-body simulations of the Quijote suite, we quantify for the first time the full information content of the redshift-space halo bispectrum down to nonlinear scales using a Fisher matrix forecast of \{{$\Omega$}m, {$\Omega$}b, h, ns, {$\sigma$}8, M{$\nu\rbrace$}. For kmax=0.5 H/Mpc, the bispectrum provides {$\Omega$}m, {$\Omega$}b, h, ns, and {$\sigma$}8 constraints 1.9, 2.6, 3.1, 3.6, and 2.6 times tighter than the power spectrum. For M{$\nu$}, the bispectrum improves the 1{$\sigma$} constraint from 0.2968 to 0.0572 eV\textemdash over 5 times tighter than the power spectrum. Even with priors from Planck, the bispectrum improves M{$\nu$} constraints by a factor of 1.8. Although we reserve marginalizing over a more complete set of bias parameters to the next paper of the series, these constraints are derived for a (1 h-1Gpc)3 box, a substantially smaller volume than upcoming surveys. Thus, our results demonstrate that the bispectrum offers significant improvements over the power spectrum, especially for constraining M{$\nu$}.\vphantom\}},

We recommend a specific set of 52 weightings containing only combinations of fundamental modes, constructed to yield a minimum variance estimate of the covariance of power. Numerical tests reveal that at non-linear scales the variance of power estimated by the weightings method substantially exceeds that estimated from a simple ensemble method. We argue that the discrepancy is caused by beat-coupling, in which products of closely spaced Fourier modes couple by non-linear gravitational growth to the beat mode between them. Beat-coupling appears whenever non-linear power is measured from Fourier modes with a finite spread of wavevector, and is therefore present in the weightings method but not in the ensemble method. Beat-coupling inevitably affects real galaxy surveys, whose Fourier modes have finite width. Surprisingly, the beat-coupling contribution dominates the covariance of power at non-linear scales, so that, counter-intuitively, it is expected that the covariance of non-linear power in galaxy surveys is dominated not by small-scale structure, but rather by beat-coupling to the largest scales of the survey.},

A sensitive test of this dependence - the marked correlation function - reveals highly significant evidence that haloes of a given mass form earlier in denser regions. We define a marked cross-correlation function, which helps quantify how this effect depends upon the choice of the halo population used to define the environment. The mean halo formation redshift as a function of the local overdensity in dark matter is also well determined, and we see an especially clear dependence for galaxy-sized haloes. This contradicts one of the basic predictions of the excursion set model of structure formation, even though we see that this theory predicts other features of the distribution of halo formation epochs rather well. It also invalidates an assumption usually employed in the popular halo, or halo occupation distribution, models of galaxy clustering, namely that the distribution of halo properties is a function of halo mass but not of halo environment.},

  abstract = {The effect of baryonic feedback on the dark matter mass distribution is generally considered to be a nuisance to weak gravitational lensing. Measurements of cosmological parameters are affected as feedback alters the cosmic shear signal on angular scales smaller than a few arcminutes. Recent progress on the numerical modelling of baryon physics has shown that this effect could be so large that, rather than being a nuisance, the effect can be constrained with current weak lensing surveys, hence providing an alternative astrophysical insight on one of the most challenging questions of galaxy formation. In order to perform our analysis, we construct an analytic fitting formula that describes the effect of the baryons on the mass power spectrum. This fitting formula is based on three scenarios of the OverWhelmingly Large hydrodynamical simulations. It is specifically calibrated for z {$<$} 1.5, where it models the simulations to an accuracy that is better than 2 per cent for scales k {$<$} 10 h Mpc-1 and better than 5 per cent for 10 {$<$} k {$<$} 100 h Mpc-1. Equipped with this precise tool, this paper presents the first constraint on baryonic feedback models using gravitational lensing data, from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). In this analysis, we show that the effect of neutrino mass on the mass power spectrum is degenerate with the baryonic feedback at small angular scales and cannot be ignored. Assuming a cosmology precision fixed by WMAP9, we find that a universe with massless neutrinos is rejected by the CFHTLenS lensing data with 85-98 per cent confidence, depending on the baryon feedback model. Some combinations of feedback and non-zero neutrino masses are also disfavoured by the data, although it is not yet possible to isolate a unique neutrino mass and feedback model. Our study shows that ongoing weak gravitational lensing surveys (KiDS, HSC and DES) will offer a unique opportunity to probe the physics of baryons at galactic scales, in addition to the expected constraints on the total neutrino mass.},

Conventional HOD formulations assume that only halo mass governs the galaxy-halo connection. Violations of this assumption, known as galaxy assembly bias, threaten the HOD programme. We introduce decorated HODs, a new, flexible class of models designed to account for assembly bias. Decorated HODs minimally expand the parameter space and maximize the independence between traditional and novel HOD parameters. We use decorated HODs to quantify the influence of assembly bias on clustering and lensing statistics. For SDSS-like samples, the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering can be as large as a factor of 2 on r {$\sim$} 200 kpc scales and {$\sim$}15 per cent in the linear regime. Assembly bias can either enhance or diminish clustering on large scales, but generally increases clustering on scales r {$\lessequivlnt$} 1 Mpc. We performed our calculations with HALOTOOLS, an open-source, community-driven PYTHON package for studying the galaxy-halo connection (http://halotools.readthedocs.org). We conclude by describing the use of decorated HODs to treat assembly bias in otherwise conventional likelihood analyses.},

We outline numerical methods for estimating parameters from data, including Monte Carlo Markov Chains and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method.

Precision cosmological probes targeted primarily at investigations of dark energy require accurate theoretical determinations of the power spectrum in the nonlinear regime. To exploit the observational power of future cosmological surveys, accuracy demands on the theory are at the one percent level or better. Numerical simulations are currently the only way to produce sufficiently error-controlled predictions for the power spectrum. The very high computational cost of (precision) N-body simulations is a major obstacle to obtaining predictions in the nonlinear regime, while scanning over cosmological parameters. Near-future observations, however, are likely to provide a meaningful constraint only on constant dark energy equation of state 'wCDM' cosmologies. In this paper we demonstrate that a limited set of only 37 cosmological models -- the "Coyote Universe" suite -- can be used to predict the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the required accuracy over a prior parameter range set by cosmic microwave background observations. This paper is the second in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum for wCDM cosmologies.},

On scales k {$\greaterequivlnt$} 4 h Mpc-1 the effect of baryons on the amplitude of the total matter power spectrum is greater than 1 per cent. The back-reaction of baryons affects the density field of the dark matter at the level of {$\sim$}3 per cent on scales of 1 {$\leq$} k/( h Mpc-1) {$\leq$} 5. The dark matter velocity divergence power spectrum at k {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.5 h Mpc-1 is changed by less than 1 per cent. The 2D redshift space power spectrum is affected at the level of {$\sim$}6 per cent at |k|{$\greaterequivlnt$} 1 h Mpc\^\{-1\} (for {$\mu$} {$>$} 0.5), but for |k|{$\leq$} 0.4 h Mpc\^\{-1\} it differs by less than 1 per cent. We report vanishingly small baryonic velocity bias for haloes: the peculiar velocities of haloes with M200 {$>$} 3 \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$} (hosting galaxies with M* {$>$} 109 M{$\odot$}) are affected at the level of at most 1 km s-1, which is negligible for 1 per cent-precision cosmology. We caution that since EAGLE overestimates cluster gas fractions it may also underestimate the impact of baryons, particularly for the total matter power spectrum. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that for theoretical modelling of redshift space distortions and galaxy velocity-based statistics, baryons and their back-reaction can be safely ignored at the current level of observational accuracy. However, we confirm that the modelling of the total matter power spectrum in weak lensing studies needs to include realistic galaxy formation physics in order to achieve the accuracy required in the precision cosmology era.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effect of orientation-dependent selection effects on galaxy clustering in redshift space. It is found that if galaxies are aligned by large-scale tidal fields, then these selection effects give rise to a dependence of the observed galaxy density on the local tidal field, in addition to the well-known dependences on the matter density and radial velocity gradient. This alters the galaxy power spectrum in a way that is different for Fourier modes parallel to and perpendicular to the line of sight. These tidal galaxy alignments can thus mimic redshift space distortions (RSD), and thus result in a bias in the measurement of the velocity power spectrum. If galaxy orientations are affected only by the local tidal field, then the tidal alignment effect has exactly the same scale and angular dependence as the RSDs in the linear regime, so it cannot be projected out or removed by masking small scales in the analysis. We consider several toy models of tidal alignments and orientation-dependent selection, normalize their free parameter (an amplitude) to recent observations, and find that they could bias the velocity amplitude f(z)G(z) by 5-10 per cent in some models, although most models give much smaller contamination. We conclude that tidal alignments may be a significant systematic error in RSD measurements that aim to test general relativity via the growth of large-scale structure. We briefly discuss possible mitigation strategies.},

We review the imprint of each parameter on the CMB. Assuming only that the primordial perturbations were adiabatic, we use a covariance-matrix approach to estimate the precision with which these parameters can be determined by a CMB temperature map as a function of the fraction of sky mapped, the level of pixel noise, and the angular resolution. For example, with no prior information about any of the cosmological parameters, a full-sky CMB map with 0.5\textdegree{} angular resolution and a noise level of 15 {$\mu$}K per pixel can determine {$\Omega$}, h, and {$\Lambda$} with standard errors of +/-0.1 or better, and provide determinations of other parameters which are inaccessible with traditional observations. Smaller beam sizes or prior information on some of the other parameters from other observations improves the sensitivity. The dependence on the underlying cosmological model is discussed.},

  abstract = {In the Standard Model, neutrinos are massless, yet oscillation experiments show in fact they do have a small mass. Currently only the differences of the masses' squares are known, and an upper bound on the sum. However, upcoming surveys of the Universe's large-scale structure (LSS) can probe the neutrino mass by exposing how neutrinos modulate galaxy clustering. But these measurements are challenging: in looking at the clustering of galaxy pairs, the effect of neutrinos is degenerate with galaxy formation, the details of which are unknown. Marginalizing over them degrades the constraints. Here we show that using correlations of galaxy triplets---the 3-Point Correlation Function or its Fourier-space analog the bispectrum---can break the degeneracy between galaxy formation physics (known as biasing) and the neutrino mass. Specifically, we find a signature of neutrinos in the bispectrum's dipole moment (with respect to triangle opening angle) that is roughly orthogonal to the contribution of galaxy biases. This signature was missed in previous works by failing to account for how neutrinos alter mode-coupling between perturbations on different scales. Our proposed signature will contribute to upcoming LSS surveys' such as DESI making a robust detection of the neutrino mass. We estimate that it can offer several-\$\textbackslash sigma\$ evidence for non-zero \$m\_\{\textbackslash nu\}\$ with DESI from the bispectrum alone, and that this is independent from information in the galaxy power spectrum.},

These effects are all combined in a single PNG forecast for the first time. Moreover, we improve the bispectrum modelling over previous forecasts, by accounting for trispectrum contributions. All effects have an impact on final predicted bounds, which varies with the type of survey. We find that the bispectrum can lead to improvements up to a factor{\~ }5 over bounds based on the power spectrum alone, leading to significantly better constraints for local-type PNG, with respect to current limits from Planck. Future radio and photometric surveys could obtain a measurement error of {$\sigma$} (f\_\{NL\}\^\{loc\}) {$\approx$} 0.2. In the case of equilateral PNG, galaxy bispectrum can improve upon present bounds only if significant improvements in the redshift determinations of future, large volume, photometric or radio surveys could be achieved.

Here we consider the effect on the galaxy bispectrum, which has attracted interest as a way to break the degeneracy between galaxy bias and the amplitude of matter fluctuations {$\sigma$}8. We consider two models of intrinsic galaxy alignments: one where the probability distribution for the galaxy's orientation contains a term linear in the local tidal field, appropriate for elliptical galaxies; and one with a term quadratic in the local tidal field, which may be applicable to disc galaxies. We compute the correction to the redshift space bispectrum in the quasi-linear regime, and then focus on its effects on parameter constraints from the transverse bispectrum, i.e. using triangles ? in the plane of the sky. We show that in the linear alignment model, intrinsic alignments result in an error in the galaxy bias parameters, but do not affect the inferred value of {$\sigma$}8. In contrast, the quadratic alignment model results in a systematic error in both the bias parameters and {$\sigma$}8. However, the quadratic alignment effect has a unique configuration dependence that should enable it to be removed in upcoming surveys.},

The observational sample is volume limited out to z = 0.1 with Mr - 5 log (h) {$\leq$} -19.6. We construct a mock catalogue of galaxies that shows a similar signal of assembly bias (46 {$\pm$} 9 per cent) at the same halo mass. We then adapt the model presented by Lacerna \& Padilla (Paper I) to redefine the overdensity peak height, which traces the assembly bias such that galaxies in equal density peaks show the same clustering regardless of their stellar age, but this time using observational features such as a flux limit. The proxy for peak height, which is proposed as a better alternative than the virial mass, consists in the total mass given by the mass of neighbour host haloes in cylinders centred at each central galaxy. The radius of the cylinder is parameterized as a function of stellar age and virial mass. The best-fitting sets of parameters that make the assembly bias signal lower than 5-15 per cent for both SDSS and mock central galaxies are similar. The idea behind the parameterization is not to minimize the bias, but it is to use this method to understand the physical features that produce the assembly bias effect. Even though the tracers of the density field used here differ significantly from those used in Paper I, our analysis of the simulated catalogue indicates that the different tracers produce correlated proxies, and therefore the reason behind assembly bias is the crowding of peaks in both simulations and the SDSS.},

  abstract = {Extracting accurate cosmological information from galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter correlation functions on non-linear scales (\$\textbackslash lesssim 10 h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash mathrm\{Mpc\}\$) requires cosmological simulations. Additionally, one has to marginalise over several nuisance parameters of the galaxy-halo connection. However, the computational cost of such simulations prohibits naive implementations of stochastic posterior sampling methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that would require of order \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(10\^6)\$ samples in cosmological parameter space. Several groups have proposed surrogate models as a solution: a so-called emulator is trained to reproduce observables for a limited number of realisations in parameter space. Afterwards, this emulator is used as a surrogate model in an MCMC analysis. Here, we demonstrate a different method called Cosmological Evidence Modelling (CEM). First, for each simulation, we calculate the Bayesian evidence marginalised over the galaxy-halo connection by repeatedly populating the simulation with galaxies. We show that this Bayesian evidence is directly related to the posterior probability of cosmological parameters. Finally, we build a physically motivated model for how the evidence depends on cosmological parameters as sampled by the simulations. We demonstrate the feasibility of CEM by using simulations from the Aemulus simulation suite and forecasting cosmological constraints from BOSS CMASS measurements of redshift-space distortions. Our analysis includes an exploration of how galaxy assembly bias affects cosmological inference. Overall, CEM has several potential advantages over the more common approach of emulating summary statistics, including the ability to easily marginalise over highly complex models of the galaxy-halo connection and greater accuracy, thereby reducing the number of simulations required.},

  abstract = {We investigate effects of baryon dissipation on the dark matter virial scaling relation between total mass and velocity dispersion and the velocity bias of galaxies in groups and clusters using self-consistent cosmological simulations. We show that the baryon dissipation increases the velocity dispersion of dark matter within the virial radius by {$\approx$}5\%-10\%. The effect is mainly driven by the change in density and gravitational potential in inner regions of cluster, and it is larger in lower mass systems where gas cooling and star formation are more efficient. We also show that the galaxy velocity bias depends on how galaxies are selected. Galaxies selected based on their stellar mass exhibit no velocity bias, while galaxies selected based on their total mass show positive bias of {$\approx$}10\%, consistent with previous results based on collisionless dark matter only simulations. We further find that observational estimates of galaxy velocity dispersion are unbiased with respect to the velocity dispersion of dark matter, provided galaxies are selected using their stellar masses and their velocity dispersions are computed with more than 20 most massive galaxies. Velocity dispersions estimated with fewer galaxies, on the other hand, can lead to a significant underestimate of dynamical masses. Results presented in this paper should be useful in interpreting high-redshift groups and clusters as well as cosmological constraints derived from upcoming optical cluster surveys.},

The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of \textasciitilde 0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) \&lt; 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution \textasciitilde 250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

  abstract = {Using data from the COSMOS survey, we perform the first joint analysis  of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z = 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of the SHMR rises sharply at M * {$>$} 5 \texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * \textasciitilde{} 27 at M * = 4.5 \texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} and Mh = 1.2 \texttimes{} 1012 M {$\odot$}. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot halo mass," M piv h , and the "pivot ratio," (Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv  h and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M piv * = 5.75 {$\pm$} 0.13 \texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} at z = 0.88 to M piv * = 3.55 {$\pm$} 0.17 \texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of M piv h leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv \textasciitilde{} 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic nucleus feedback.

  abstract = {As a major source of cosmological information, galaxy clustering is susceptible to long-wavelength density and tidal fluctuations. These long modes modulate the growth and expansion rate of local structures, shifting them in both amplitude and scale. These effects are often named the growth and dilation effects, respectively. In particular the dilation shifts the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak and breaks the assumption of the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) test. This cannot be removed with reconstruction techniques because the effect originates from long modes outside the survey. In redshift space, the long modes generate a large-scale radial peculiar velocity that affects the redshift-space distortion (RSD) signal. We compute the redshift-space response functions of the galaxy power spectrum to long density and tidal modes at leading order in perturbation theory, including both the growth and dilation terms. We validate these response functions against measurements from simulated galaxy mock catalogs. As one application, long density and tidal modes beyond the scale of a survey correlate various observables leading to an excess error known as the super-sample covariance, and thus weaken their constraining power. We quantify the super-sample effect on BAO, AP, and RSD measurements, and study its impact on current and future surveys.},

  abstract = {Amongst standard model parameters that are constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations, the optical depth {$\tau$} stands out as a nuisance parameter. While {$\tau$} provides some crude limits on reionization, it also degrades constraints on other cosmological parameters. Here we explore how 21 cm cosmology\textemdash as a direct probe of reionization\textemdash can be used to independently predict {$\tau$} in an effort to improve CMB parameter constraints. We develop two complementary schemes for doing so. The first uses 21 cm power spectrum observations in conjunction with semianalytic simulations to predict {$\tau$} . The other uses global 21 cm measurements to directly constrain low redshift (post-reheating) contributions to {$\tau$} in a relatively model-independent way. Forecasting the performance of the upcoming hydrogen epoch of reionization array, we find that significant reductions in the errors on {$\tau$} can be achieved. These results are particularly effective at breaking the CMB degeneracy between {$\tau$} and the amplitude of the primordial fluctuation spectrum A\textsubscript{s}, with errors on ln (10\textsuperscript{10}A\textsubscript{s}) reduced by up to a factor of 4. Stage 4 CMB constraints on the neutrino mass sum are also improved, with errors potentially reduced to 12 meV regardless of whether CMB experiments can precisely measure the reionization bump in polarization power spectra. Observations of the 21 cm line are therefore capable of improving not only our understanding of reionization astrophysics, but also of cosmology in general.},

  abstract = {The relationship between galaxies and dark matter (DM) can be  characterized by the halo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that are satellites. Here, we present observational constraints from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on these quantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351507 lenses. We use stellar masses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weak gravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in the halo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. We find that an L* galaxy with a stellar mass of 6 \texttimes{} 1010Msolar is hosted by a halo with mass of 1.4 \texttimes{} 1012h-1Msolar, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversion efficiencies of 17+10-5 per cent (early-types) and 16+15-6 per cent (late-types) at the 95 per cent confidence level (statistical, not including systematic uncertainty due to assumption of a universal initial mass function). We find that for a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology below Mstellar = 1011Msolar, in contrast to typically a factor of 2 difference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity. This suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range and should be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed. For higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function of stellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early- and late-types become larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster haloes with masses above 1013Msolar host ellipticals at the centre, while even the brightest central spirals are hosted by haloes of mass below 1013Msolar. We find that the fraction of spirals that are satellites is roughly 10-15 per cent independent of stellar mass or luminosity, while for ellipticals this fraction decreases with stellar mass from 50 per cent at 1010Msolar to 10 per cent at 3 \texttimes{} 1011Msolar or 20 per cent at the maximum luminosity considered. We split the elliptical sample by local density, and find that at a given luminosity there is no difference in the signal on scales below 100h-1kpc between high- and low-density regions, suggesting that tidal stripping inside large haloes does not remove most of the DM from the early-type satellites. This result is dominated by haloes in the mass range 1013-1014h-1Msolar, and is an average over all separations from the group or cluster centre.},

  abstract = {The anisotropy of galaxy clustering in redshift space has long been used to probe the rate of growth of cosmological perturbations. However, if galaxies are aligned by large-scale tidal fields, then a sample with an orientation-dependent selection effect has an additional anisotropy imprinted on to its correlation function. We use the LOWZ and CMASS catalogues of SDSS-III BOSS Data Release 12 to divide galaxies into two subsamples based on their offset from the Fundamental Plane, which should be correlated with orientation. These subsamples must trace the same underlying cosmology, but have opposite orientation-dependent selection effects. We measure the clustering parameters of each subsample and compare them in order to calculate the dimensionless parameter B, a measure of how strongly galaxies are aligned by gravitational tidal fields. We found that for CMASS (LOWZ), the measured B was -0.024 {$\pm$} 0.015 (-0.030 {$\pm$} 0.016). This result can be compared to the theoretical predictions of Hirata, who argued that since galaxy formation physics does not depend on the direction of the `observer,' the same intrinsic alignment parameters that describe galaxy-ellipticity correlations should also describe intrinsic alignments in the radial direction. We find that the ratio of observed to theoretical values is 0.51 {$\pm$} 0.32 (0.77 {$\pm$} 0.41) for CMASS (LOWZ). We combine the results to obtain a total Obs/Theory = 0.61 {$\pm$} 0.26.

We present a halo mass function emulator and demonstrate improved accuracy relative to state-of-the-art analytic models. In this work, mass is defined using an overdensity criteria of 200 relative to the mean background density. Our emulator is constructed from the AEMULUS simulations, a suite of 40 N-body simulations with snapshots from z=3 to z=0. These simulations cover the flat wCDM parameter space allowed by recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Type Ia Supernovae results, varying the parameters w, Omega\_m, Omega\_b, sigma\_8, N\_\{eff\}, n\_s, and H\_0. We validate our emulator using five realizations of seven different cosmologies, for a total of 35 test simulations. These test simulations were not used in constructing the emulator, and were run with fully independent initial conditions. We use our test simulations to characterize the modeling uncertainty of the emulator, and introduce a novel way of marginalizing over the associated systematic uncertainty. We confirm non-universality in our halo mass function emulator as a function of both cosmological parameters and redshift. Our emulator achieves better than 1\% precision over much of the relevant parameter space, and we demonstrate that the systematic uncertainty in our emulator will remain a negligible source of error for cluster abundance studies through at least the LSST Year 1 data set.},

  abstract = {We use the kinematics of satellite galaxies that orbit around the central galaxy in a dark matter halo to infer the scaling relations between halo mass and central galaxy properties. Using galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the halo mass-luminosity relation (MLR) and the halo mass-stellar mass relation (MSR) of central galaxies. In particular, we focus on the dependence of these scaling relations on the colour of the central galaxy. We find that red central galaxies on average occupy more massive haloes than blue central galaxies of the same luminosity. However, at fixed stellar mass there is no appreciable difference in the average halo mass of red and blue centrals, especially for M*{$\lessequivlnt$} 1010.5 h-2 M{$\odot$}. This indicates that stellar mass is a better indicator of halo mass than luminosity. Nevertheless, we find that the scatter in halo masses at fixed stellar mass is non-negligible for both red and blue centrals. It increases as a function of stellar mass for red centrals but shows a fairly constant behaviour for blue centrals. We compare the scaling relations obtained in this paper with results from other independent studies of satellite kinematics, with results from a SDSS galaxy group catalog, from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements and from subhalo abundance matching studies. Overall, these different techniques yield MLRs and MSRs in fairly good agreement with each other (typically within a factor of 2), indicating that we are converging on an accurate and reliable description of the galaxy-dark matter connection. We briefly discuss some of the remaining discrepancies among the various methods.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the relation between the masses of cluster-  and group-sized haloes, extracted from {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological N-body and hydrodynamic simulations, and their velocity dispersion at different redshifts from z = 2 to 0. The main aim of this analysis is to understand how the implementation of baryonic physics in simulations affects such relations, i.e. to what extent the use of the velocity dispersion as a proxy for cluster mass determination is hampered by the imperfect knowledge of the baryonic physics. In our analysis, we use several sets of simulations with different physics implemented: one DM-only simulation, one simulation with non-radiative gas, and two radiative simulations, one of which with feedback from active galactic nuclei. Velocity dispersions are determined using three different tracers: DM particles, subhaloes and galaxies. We confirm that DM particles trace a relation that is fully consistent with the theoretical expectations based on the virial theorem, {$\sigma$}v {$\propto$} M{$\alpha$} with {$\alpha$} = 1/3, and with previous results presented in the literature. On the other hand, subhaloes and galaxies trace steeper relations, with velocity dispersion scaling with mass with {$\alpha$} {$>$} 1/3, and with larger values of the normalization. Such relations imply that galaxies and subhaloes have a {$\sim$}10 per cent velocity bias relative to the DM particles, which can be either positive or negative, depending on the halo mass, redshift and physics implemented in the simulation. We explain these differences as due to dynamical processes, namely dynamical friction and tidal disruption, acting on substructures and galaxies, but not on DM particles. These processes appear to be more or less effective, depending on the halo masses and the importance of baryon cooling, and may create a non-trivial dependence of the velocity bias and the {$\sigma$}1D-M200 relation on the tracer, the halo mass and its redshift. These results are relevant in view of the application of velocity dispersion as a proxy for cluster masses in ongoing and future large redshift surveys.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

We measure significant cross-correlations between large-scale tidal fields and several non-scalar halo properties: shapes, velocity dispersion, and angular momentum. Selection effects that couple to these non-scalar halo properties can produce anisotropic clustering even in real-space. We investigate the size of this effect and show that it can produce a non-zero quadrupole similar in size to the one generated by linear redshift-space distortions (RSD). Finally, we investigate the clustering properties of halos identified in redshift-space and find enormous deviations from the standard linear RSD model, again caused by anisotropic assembly bias. These effects could contaminate the values of cosmological parameters inferred from the observed redshift-space clustering of galaxies, groups, or 21cm emission from atomic hydrogen, if their selection depends on properties affected by halo assembly bias. We briefly discuss ways in which this effect can be measured in existing and future large-scale structure surveys.},

  abstract = {Dark matter (DM) haloes forming near the thermal cut-off scale of the density perturbations are unique, since they are the smallest objects and form through monolithic gravitational collapse, while larger haloes contrastingly have experienced mergers. While standard cold dark matter simulations readily produce haloes that follow the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile with an inner slope, \$\textbackslash rho \textbackslash propto r\^\{-\textbackslash alpha\}\$, with \$\textbackslash alpha=1\$, recent simulations have found that when the free-streaming cut-off is resolved, the resulting haloes follow nearly power-law density profiles of \$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash sim1.5\$. In this paper, we study the formation of density cusps in haloes using idealized \$N\$-body simulations of the collapse of proto-haloes. When the proto-halo profile is initially cored due to particle free-streaming at high redshift, we universally find \$\textbackslash sim r\^\{-1.5\}\$ profiles irrespective of the proto-halo profile slope outside the core and large-scale non-spherical perturbations. Quite in contrast, when the proto-halo has a power-law profile, then we obtain profiles compatible with the NFW shape when the density slope of the proto-halo patch is shallower than a critical value, \$\textbackslash alpha\_\{\textbackslash rm ini\} \textbackslash sim 0.3\$, while the final slope can be steeper for \$\textbackslash alpha\_\{\textbackslash rm ini\}\textbackslash gtrsim 0.3\$. We further demonstrate that the \$r\^\{-1.5\}\$ profiles are sensitive to small scale noise, which gradually drives them towards an inner slope of \$-1\$, where they become resilient to such perturbations. We demonstrate that the \$r\^\{-1.5\}\$ solutions are in hydrostatic equilibrium, largely consistent with a simple analytic model, and provide arguments that angular momentum appears to determine the inner slope.},

  abstract = {We propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistic theories for galaxy bias. We first show that the low-order clustering statistics of the dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and density profiles of dark-matter haloes. The quasi-linear mass correlations are in fact reproduced well by a model of independent randomly-placed haloes. The distribution of galaxies within the halo density field depends on: (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation number - the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a halo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo. The first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups. For the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with any remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. This second assumption is essential if small-scale galaxy correlations are to remain close to a single power law, rather than flattening in the same way as the correlations of the overall density field. These simple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the probability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass density. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current interest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy correlations for a flat {$\Omega$}=0.3 model ({$\Lambda$}CDM), but not for an {$\Omega$}=1 model with the same power spectrum ({$\tau$}CDM). This is an inevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra: cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high {$\Omega$}, and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies in the {$\Lambda$}CDM model is lower than that of the mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number for the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of galaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.},

On large scales we find that the matter power spectrum measured from our supercluster sample has at least twice as much power as that measured from our random sample. Our investigation of the effect of baryonic physics on the matter power spectrum is found to be in agreement with previous studies and is weaker than the selection effect over the majority of scales. In addition, we investigate the effect of targeting a cosmologically non-representative, supercluster region of the sky on the weak lensing shear power spectrum. We do this by generating shear and convergence maps using a line-of-sight integration technique, which intercepts our random and supercluster sub-volumes. We find the convergence power spectrum measured from our supercluster sample has a larger amplitude than that measured from the random sample at all scales. We frame our results within the context of the Super-CLuster Assisted Shear Survey (Super-CLASS), which aims to measure the cosmic shear signal in the radio band by targeting a region of the sky that contains five Abell clusters. Assuming the Super-CLASS survey will have a source density of 1.5 galaxies arcmin-2, we forecast a detection significance of 2.7\^\{+1.5\}\_\{-1.2\}, which indicates that in the absence of systematics the Super-CLASS project could make a cosmic shear detection with radio data alone.},

In doing this, we make use of a series of dark matter halo catalogues extracted from the BASICC simulation. The mock data are analysed via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo likelihood analysis. We find a fitting function that well describes the dependence of the error on bias, density and volume, showing a decrease in the error as the bias and volume increase, and a decrease with density down to an almost constant value for high-density values. This fitting formula allows us to produce forecasts on the precision achievable with future surveys on measurements of the neutrino mass fraction. For example, a Euclid-like spectroscopic survey should be able to measure the neutrino mass fraction with an accuracy of {$\delta$}f\textsubscript{{$\nu$}} {$\approx$} 3.1 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{-3} (which is equivalent to {$\delta\sum$}m\textsubscript{{$\nu$}} {$\approx$} 0.039eV), using redshift-space clustering once all the other cosmological parameters are kept fixed to the {$\Lambda$}CDM case.},

We find that the HOD with Friends-of-Friends groups can reproduce galaxy clustering better than gravitationally bound haloes. This indicates that Friends-of-Friends groups are more directly related to the clustering of these regions than the bound particles of the overdensities. In general, we find that the reconstruction works at best to {$\simeq$}5 per cent accuracy: it underestimates the bias for bright galaxies. This translates to an overestimation of 50 per cent in the halo mass when we use clustering to calibrate mass. We also found a degeneracy on the mass prediction from the clustering amplitude that affects all the masses. This effect is due to the clustering dependence on the host halo substructure, an indication of assembly bias. We show that the clustering of haloes of a given mass increases with the number of subhaloes, a result that only depends on the underlying matter distribution. As the number of galaxies increases with the number of subhaloes in SAMs, this results in a low bias for the HOD reconstruction. We expect this effect to apply to other models of galaxy formation, including the real Universe, as long as the number of galaxies increases with the number of subhaloes. We have also found that the reconstructions of galaxy bias from the HOD model fail for low-mass haloes with M {$\lessequivlnt$} 3-5 \texttimes{} 1011 h-1 M{$\odot$}. We find that this is because galaxy clustering is more strongly affected by assembly bias for these low masses.},

This is not totally surprising as, according to the peak-background split model, local matter density (bar {$\delta$}) is the property that constrains bias at large scales. Massive haloes have a high clustering because they reside in high density regions. Small haloes can be found in a wide range of environments which differentially determine their clustering amplitudes. This contradicts the assumption made by standard halo occupation distribution (HOD) models that bias and occupation of haloes is determined solely by their mass. We show that the bias of central galaxies from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation as a function of luminosity and colour is therefore not correctly predicted by the standard HOD model. Using bar {$\delta$} (of matter or galaxies) instead of halo mass, the HOD model correctly predicts galaxy bias. These results indicate the need to include information about local density and not only mass in order to correctly apply HOD analysis in these galaxy samples. This new model can be readily applied to observations and has the advantage that, in contrast with the dark matter halo mass, the galaxy density can be directly observed.},

  abstract = {We use analytic computations to predict the power spectrum as well as the bispectrum of Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) anisotropies. Our approach is based on the halo model and takes into account the mean luminosity-mass relation. The model is used to forecast the possibility to simultaneously constrain cosmological, CIB and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters in the presence of foregrounds. For the analysis we use wavelengths in eight frequency channels between 200 and 900\$\textbackslash;\textbackslash mathrm\{GHz\}\$ with survey specifications given by Planck and LiteBird. We explore the sensitivity to the model parameters up to multipoles of \$\textbackslash ell =1000\$ using auto- and cross-correlations between the different frequency bands. With this setting, cosmological, HOD and CIB parameters can be constrained to a few percent. Galactic dust is modeled by a power law and the shot noise contribution as a frequency dependent amplitude which are marginalized over. We find that dust residuals in the CIB maps only marginally influence constraints on standard cosmological parameters. Furthermore, the bispectrum yields tighter constraints (by a factor four in \$1\textbackslash sigma\$ errors) on almost all model parameters while the degeneracy directions are very similar to the ones of the power spectrum. The increase in sensitivity is most pronounced for the sum of the neutrino masses. Due to the similarity of degeneracies a combination of both analysis is not needed for most parameters. This, however, might be due to the simplified bias description generally adopted in such halo model approaches.},

We compare the BOSS results with the predictions of a halo abundance matching (HAM) clustering model that assigns galaxies to dark matter haloes selected from the large BigMultiDark N-body simulation of a flat {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter Planck cosmology. We compare the observational data with the simulated ones on a light cone constructed from 20 subsequent outputs of the simulation. Observational effects such as incompleteness, geometry, veto masks and fibre collisions are included in the model, which reproduces within 1{$\sigma$} errors the observed monopole of the two-point correlation function at all relevant scales: from the smallest scales, 0.5 h-1 Mpc, up to scales beyond the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. This model also agrees remarkably well with the BOSS galaxy power spectrum (up to k \texttildelow{} 1 h Mpc-1), and the three-point correlation function. The quadrupole of the correlation function presents some tensions with observations. We discuss possible causes that can explain this disagreement, including target selection effects. Overall, the standard HAM model describes remarkably well the clustering statistics of the CMASS sample. We compare the stellar-to-halo mass relation for the CMASS sample measured using weak lensing in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82 Survey with the prediction of our clustering model, and find a good agreement within 1{$\sigma$}. The BigMD-BOSS light cone including properties of BOSS galaxies and halo properties is made publicly available.},

We quantify the impact of baryonic physics using a set of cosmological numerical simulations. Each simulation has the same initial density field, but models a different set of physical processes. We find that baryonic processes significantly alter predictions for the matter power spectrum relative to models that include only gravitational interactions. Our results imply that future weak-lensing experiments such as LSST and SNAP will likely be sensitive to the uncertain physics governing the nonlinear evolution of the baryonic component of the universe if these experiments are primarily limited by statistical uncertainties. In particular, this effect could be important for forecasts of the constraining power of future surveys if information from scales l {$>\sptilde$} 1000 is included in the analysis. We find that deviations are caused primarily by the rearrangement of matter within individual dark matter halos relative to the gravity-only case, rather than a large-scale rearrangement of matter. Consequently, we propose a simple model, based on the phenomenological halo model of dark matter clustering, for baryonic effects that can be used to aid in the interpretation of forthcoming weak-lensing data.},

  abstract = {Future or ongoing galaxy redshift surveys can put stringent constraints on neutrinos masses via the high-precision measurements of galaxy power spectrum, when combined with CMB information. In this paper we develop a method to model galaxy power spectrum in the weakly nonlinear regime for a mixed dark matter [cold dark matter (CDM) plus finite-mass neutrinos] model, based on perturbation theory (PT) whose validity is well tested by simulations for a CDM model. In doing this we carefully study various aspects of the nonlinear clustering (nonlinear neutrino perturbations and the higher-order growth functions), and then arrive at a useful approximation allowing for a quick computation of the nonlinear power spectrum as in the CDM case. The nonlinear galaxy bias is also included in a self-consistent manner within the PT framework. Thus, the use of our PT model can give a more robust understanding of the measured galaxy power spectrum as well as allow for higher sensitivity to neutrino masses due to the gain of Fourier modes beyond the linear regime. Based on the Fisher matrix formalism, we find that the BOSS or Stage-III type survey, when combined with Planck CMB information, gives a precision of total neutrino mass constraint, {$\sigma$}(m\textsubscript{{$\nu$},tot}){$\simeq$}0.1eV, while the Stage-IV type survey may achieve {$\sigma$}(m\textsubscript{{$\nu$},tot}){$\simeq$}0.05eV, i.e., more than a 1-{$\sigma$} detection of neutrino masses. We also discuss possible systematic errors on dark energy parameters caused by the neutrino mass uncertainty. The significant correlation between neutrino mass and dark energy parameters is found, if the information on power spectrum amplitude is included. More importantly, for the Stage-IV type survey, a best-fit dark energy model may be biased and falsely away from the underlying true model by more than the 1-{$\sigma$} statistical errors, if neutrino mass is ignored in the model fitting.},

On top of the ELUCID haloes, we develop an extended HOD model that includes the assembly bias of central and satellite galaxies, parameterized as \$\textbackslash mathcal\{Q\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{cen\}\$ and \$\textbackslash mathcal\{Q\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{sat\}\$, respectively, to predict a suite of one- and two-point observables. In particular, our fiducial constraint employs the probability distribution of the galaxy overdensity \$\textbackslash delta\^g\_8\$ and the projected correlation functions of quintiles of galaxies selected by \$\textbackslash delta\^g\_8\$. We perform extensive tests of the efficacy of our method by fitting the same observables to mock data using both constrained and non-constrained simulations. We discover that in many cases the level of cosmic variance between the two simulations can produce biased constraints that lead to an erroneous detection of galaxy assembly bias if the non-constrained simulation is used. When applying our method to the SDSS data, the ELUCID reconstruction effectively removes an otherwise strong degeneracy between cosmic variance and galaxy assembly bias in SDSS, enabling us to derive an accurate and stringent constraint on the latter. Our fiducial ELUCID constraint, for galaxies above a stellar mass threshold \$M\_* = 10\^\{10.2\}\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$, is \$\textbackslash mathcal\{Q\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{cen\} = -0.06\textbackslash pm0.09\$ and \$\textbackslash mathcal\{Q\}\_\textbackslash mathrm\{sat\}=0.08\textbackslash pm0.12\$, indicating no evidence for a significant galaxy assembly bias in the local Universe probed by SDSS. Finally, our method provides a promising path to the robust modelling of the galaxy-halo connection within future spectroscopic surveys like DESI and PFS.},

  abstract = {We study galaxy clustering using halo models, where gravitational clustering is described in terms of dark matter halos. At small scales, clustering statistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales, correlations are the result of combining non-linear perturbation theory with halo biasing. Galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles, and galaxy formation efficiency is given by the number of galaxies as a function of halo mass. This approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy power spectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, and the galaxy higher-order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scales than their dark matter counterparts, as observed in galaxy catalogs. We find that requiring to fit both the second and third order moments of the APM galaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. The data at large scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at small masses, m =10\^10 Msun/h, whereas data at smaller scales require that the number of galaxies in a halo scale as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-mass limit. These constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosity function or Tully-Fisher relation. We also predict the power spectrum, bispectrum, and higher-order moments of the mass density field. Although halo models agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higher order Sp parameters in N-body simulations, the model assumption that halos are spherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of the bispectrum at small scales. We stress the importance of finite volume effects in higher-order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.},

We construct estimators for radial distortions that, using only Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of the overdensity field multipoles for a given survey geometry, compute the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole, and generalize such estimators to the bispectrum. Using realistic mock catalogs we compare the signal to noise of two estimators for the power spectrum hexadecapole that require different number of FFTs and measure the bispectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole. The resulting algorithm is very efficient, e.g. for the BOSS survey requires about three minutes for \$\textbackslash ell=0,2,4\$ power spectra for scales up to \$k=0.3\textasciitilde h/\$Mpc and about fifteen additional minutes for \$\textbackslash ell=0,2,4\$ bispectra for all scales and triangle shapes up to \$k=0.2\textasciitilde h/\$Mpc on a single core. The speed of these estimators is essential as it makes possible to compute covariance matrices from large number of realizations of mock catalogs with realistic survey characteristics, and paves the way for improved constrains of gravity on cosmological scales, inflation and galaxy bias.},

After introducing an averaged, reasonably fast to evaluate, trispectrum estimator, we show that the expected errors on linear and quadratic bias parameters can be reduced by at least 20-40\%. Also, the inclusion of the trispectrum information, which is sensitive to "three-dimensionality" of structures, helps significantly in constraining the mass dependence of the HOD mean. Our approach depends only on adequate modeling of the abundance and large-scale clustering of halos and thus is independent of details of how galaxies are distributed within halos. This provides a consistency check on the traditional approach of using two-point statistics down to small scales, which necessarily makes more assumptions.

  abstract = {The present spatial distribution of galaxies in the Universe is non-Gaussian, with 40\% skewness in 50 Mpc/h spheres, and remarkably little is known about the information encoded in it about cosmological parameters beyond the power spectrum. In this work we present an attempt to bridge this gap by studying the bispectrum, paying particular attention to a joint analysis with the power spectrum and their combination with CMB data. We address the covariance properties of the power spectrum and bispectrum including the effects of beat coupling that lead to interesting cross-correlations, and discuss how baryon acoustic oscillations break degeneracies. We show that the bispectrum has significant information on cosmological parameters well beyond its power in constraining galaxy bias, and when combined with the power spectrum is more complementary than combining power spectra of different samples of galaxies, since non-Gaussianity provides a somewhat different direction in parameter space. In the framework of flat cosmological models we show that most of the improvement of adding bispectrum information corresponds to parameters related to the amplitude and effective spectral index of perturbations, which can be improved by almost a factor of two. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expected statistical uncertainties in sigma8 of a few percent are robust to relaxing the dark energy beyond a cosmological constant.},

Using a simple Fisher matrix analysis, we show that the bispectrum provides an excellent determination of linear and nonlinear bias parameters of intermediate and high-z galaxies, when all measurable triangle configurations down to mildly nonlinear scales, where perturbation theory is still valid, are included. The bispectrum is also a powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity.

  abstract = {Efficient estimators of Fourier-space statistics for large number of objects rely on fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which are affected by aliasing from unresolved small-scale modes due to the finite FFT grid. Aliasing takes the form of a sum over images, each of them corresponding to the Fourier content displaced by increasing multiples of the sampling frequency of the grid. These spurious contributions limit the accuracy in the estimation of Fourier-space statistics, and are typically ameliorated by simultaneously increasing grid size and discarding high-frequency modes. This results in inefficient estimates for e.g. the power spectrum when desired systematic biases are well under per cent level. We show that using interlaced grids removes odd images, which include the dominant contribution to aliasing. In addition, we discuss the choice of interpolation kernel used to define density perturbations on the FFT grid and demonstrate that using higher order interpolation kernels than the standard Cloud-In-Cell algorithm results in significant reduction of the remaining images. We show that combining fourth-order interpolation with interlacing gives very accurate Fourier amplitudes and phases of density perturbations. This results in power spectrum and bispectrum estimates that have systematic biases below 0.01 per cent all the way to the Nyquist frequency of the grid, thus maximizing the use of unbiased Fourier coefficients for a given grid size and greatly reducing systematics for applications to large cosmological data sets.},

  abstract = {We investigate an analytic model to compute the non-linear power spectrum of dark matter, galaxies and their cross-correlation. The model is based on Press-Schechter haloes, which cluster and have realistic dark matter profiles. The total power spectrum is a sum of two contributions, one from correlations between the haloes and one from correlations within the same halo. We show that such a model can give dark matter power spectra which match well with the results of N-body simulations, provided that the concentration parameter decreases with the halo mass. The galaxy power spectrum differs from the dark matter power spectrum because the pair-weighted number of galaxies does not scale with the halo mass and because most haloes harbour a central galaxy. If the pair-weighted number of galaxies increases less rapidly than the halo mass, as predicted by theoretical models and observed in clusters, then the resulting power spectrum becomes a power law with a slope close to the observed over several orders of magnitude in scale. Such a model also predicts a later onset of non-linear clustering in comparison with dark matter, which is needed to reconcile the cold dark matter (CDM) models with the data. A generic prediction of this model is that bias is scale-dependent and non-monotonic. This is particularly important for red or elliptical galaxies, which are preferentially found in larger mass haloes and for which the bias in the power spectrum may be scale-dependent even on large scales. Our predictions for galaxy-dark matter correlations, which can be observed through galaxy-galaxy lensing, show that these cannot be interpreted simply as an average halo profile of a typical galaxy, because different halo masses dominate at different scales and because larger haloes host more than one galaxy. We compute predictions for the cross-correlation coefficient as a function of scale and discuss the prospects of using cross-correlations in combination with galaxy clustering to determine the dark matter power spectrum.},

We present a novel test of this assumption, which uses the statistics of weighted or `marked' correlations, which prove to be particularly well-suited to detecting and quantifying weak correlations with environment. We find that close pairs of haloes form at slightly higher redshifts than more widely separated halo pairs, suggesting that haloes in dense regions form at slightly earlier times than haloes of the same mass in less dense regions. The environmental trends we find are useful for models that relate the properties of galaxies to the formation histories of the haloes that surround them.},

  abstract = {Interpreting the small-scale clustering of galaxies with halo models can elucidate the connection between galaxies and dark matter haloes. Unfortunately, the modelling is typically not sufficiently accurate for ruling out models statistically. It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small scales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo connection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the `accurate' regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful treatment of statistical and systematic errors. With our forward-modelling approach, we can incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional two-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) + halo model against the clustering of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) seventh data release (DR7) galaxies. Specifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity function, and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model fits each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them simultaneously. Adding group statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly tighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the adopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the cosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried (Planck cosmology with Mvir haloes) matches the clustering of low-luminosity galaxies, but exhibits a 2.3{$\sigma$} tension with the clustering of luminous galaxies, thus providing evidence that the `standard' halo model needs to be extended. This work opens the door to adding interesting freedom to the halo model and including additional clustering statistics as constraints.},

  abstract = {It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that is the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest halo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter potential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption made in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper, we test the validity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group, we compute two statistics, ? and ?, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group members. By comparing the cumulative distributions of ? and ? to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the null hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a non-zero fraction fBNC(M) of all haloes of mass M the BHG is not the central galaxy, but instead a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that fBNC increases from {$\sim$}0.25 in low-mass haloes (1012 h-1{$\leq$}M{$\lessequivlnt$} 2 \texttimes{} 1013 h-1 M{$\odot$}) to {$\sim$}0.4 in massive haloes (M{$\greaterequivlnt$} 5 \texttimes{} 1013 h-1 M{$\odot$}). We show that these values of fBNC are uncomfortably high compared to predictions from halo occupation statistics and from semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. We end by discussing various implications of a non-zero fBNC(M), with an emphasis on the halo masses inferred from satellite kinematics.},

While the improved theoretical models have been proposed and developed to describe the apparent anisotropic clustering at weakly non-linear scales, the applicability of these models is still limited in the presence of the non-perturbative smearing effect caused by the randomness of the relative velocities. Although the cosmological constraint from the anisotropic clustering will be improved with a more elaborate theoretical model, here we consider an alternative approach using the statistical power of both the power spectrum and bispectrum at large scales. Based on the Fisher matrix analysis, we estimate the benefit of combining the power spectrum and bispectrum, finding that for the future spectroscopy survey DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument), the constraints on the cosmic expansion and growth of structure will be improved by a factor of two. This approach compensates for the loss of constraining power, using the power spectrum alone, due to the randomness of the relative velocities.},

Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k {$\sim$} 10 h Mpc-1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z {$\simeq$} 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109-1010 h-2 M{$\odot$}. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope {$\gamma$} is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to {$\gamma$} {$\sim$} 1.6 at redshift z {$\sim$} 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around {$\sim$} 5 per cent.},

For a wide range of survey volumes, the sample variance that arises from modes that are larger than the survey dominates the covariance of power spectrum estimators for modes much smaller than the survey. The deeply nonlinear version of this effect is known as halo sample variance. We show that all variants are unified by the matter trispectrum of squeezed configurations and that such configurations obey a consistency relation which relates them to the response of the power spectrum to a change in the background density. Our method also applies to statistics that are based on radial projections of the density field such as weak lensing shear. While we use the halo model for an analytic description to expose the nature of the effect, the consistency description enables an accurate calibration of the full effect directly from simulations. It also suggests that super-sample covariance may be viewed as an additional interesting signal rather than excess noise.},

We present a comprehensive discussion of methods for estimating cosmological parameters from large data sets, which includes the previously published techniques as special cases. We show that both the problem of estimating several parameters jointly and the problem of not knowing the parameters a priori can be readily solved by adding an extra singular value decomposition step. It has recently been argued that the information content in a sky map from a next-generation CMB satellite is sufficient to measure key cosmological parameters (h, {$\Omega$}, {$\Lambda$}, etc.) to an accuracy of a few percent or better--in principle. In practice, the data set is so large that both a brute force likelihood analysis and a direct expansion in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will be computationally unfeasible. We argue that it is likely that a Karhunen-Lo\`eve approach can nonetheless measure the parameters with close to maximal accuracy, if preceded by an appropriate form of quadratic ``precompression.'' We also discuss practical issues regarding parameter estimation from present and future galaxy redshift surveys and illustrate this with a generalized eigenmode analysis of the IRAS 1.2 Jy survey optimized for measuring {$\beta$} {$\equiv$} {$\Omega$}0.6/b using redshift space distortions.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the non-Gaussianity of the primordial density field have the power to considerably improve our understanding of the physics of inflation. Indeed, if we can increase the precision of current measurements by an order of magnitude, a null-detection would rule out many classes of scenarios for generating primordial fluctuations. Large-scale galaxy redshift surveys represent experiments that hold the promise to realise this goal. Thus, we model the galaxy bispectrum and forecast the accuracy with which it will probe the parameter f\textsubscript{NL}, which represents the degree of primordial local-type non Gaussianity. Specifically, we address the problem of modelling redshift space distortions (RSD) in the tree-level galaxy bispectrum including f\textsubscript{NL}. We find novel contributions associated with RSD, with the characteristic large scale amplification induced by local-type non-Gaussianity. These RSD effects must be properly accounted for in order to obtain un-biased measurements of f\textsubscript{NL} from the galaxy bispectrum. We propose an analytic template for the monopole which can be used to fit against data on large scales, extending models used in the recent measurements. Finally, we perform idealised forecasts on {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{f\textsubscript{NL}}\textemdash the accuracy of the determination of local non-linear parameter f\textsubscript{NL}\textemdash from measurements of the galaxy bispectrum. Our findings suggest that current surveys can in principle provide f\textsubscript{NL} constraints competitive with Planck, and future surveys could improve them further.},

For massive galaxies, M * {$>\sptilde$} 1010.6 M {$\odot$}, our results indicate that star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matter halos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. At lower masses, there is minimal difference in the SHMRs, implying that the majority low-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their star formation. Our analysis also affords a breakdown of all COSMOS galaxies into the relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. At z = 1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellar mass function. But the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshift evolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass central galaxies being quenched of their star formation. At M * \textasciitilde{} 1010 M {$\odot$}, the fraction of central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of 10 over our redshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at that mass is constant with redshift. We define a "migration rate" to the red sequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. We find that the migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearly an order of magnitude from z = 1 to z = 0. These results imply that the efficiency of quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, while the mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters is losing efficiency.},

  abstract = {We comprehensively analyse the cosmology dependence of counts-in-cell statistics. We focus on the shape of the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) of the matter density field at mildly nonlinear scales. Based on large-deviation statistics, we parametrise the cosmology dependence of the matter PDF in terms of the linear power spectrum, the growth factor, the spherical collapse dynamics, and the nonlinear variance. We extend our formalism to include massive neutrinos, finding that the total matter PDF is highly sensitive to the total neutrino mass \$M\_\textbackslash nu\$ and can disentangle it from the clustering amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$. Using more than a million PDFs extracted from the Quijote simulations, we determine the response of the matter PDF to changing parameters in the \$\textbackslash nu\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model and successfully cross-validate the theoretical model and the simulation measurements. We present the first \$\textbackslash nu\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM Fisher forecast for the matter PDF at multiple scales and redshifts, and its combination with the matter power spectrum. We establish that the matter PDF and the matter power spectrum are highly complementary at mildly nonlinear scales. The matter PDF is particularly powerful for constraining the matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$, clustering amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ and the total neutrino mass \$M\_\textbackslash nu\$. Adding the mildly nonlinear matter PDF to the mildly nonlinear matter power spectrum improves constraints on \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$ by a factor of 5 and \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ by a factor of 2 when considering the three lowest redshifts. In our joint analysis of the matter PDF and matter power spectrum at three redshifts, the total neutrino mass is constrained to better than 0.01 eV with a total volume of 6 (Gpc/h)\$\^3\$. We discuss how density-split statistics can be used to translate those encouraging results for the matter PDF into realistic observables in galaxy surveys.},

We extend the time-renormalization-group (RG) perturbative framework to redshift space, computing the power spectrum P\textsubscript{s}(k ,{$\mu$} ) in massive neutrino cosmologies with time-dependent dark energy equations of state w (z ). Time-RG is uniquely capable of incorporating scale-dependent growth into the P\textsubscript{s}(k ,{$\mu$} ) computation, which is important for massive neutrinos as well as modified gravity models. Although changes to w (z ) and the neutrino mass fraction both affect the late-time scale dependence of the nonlinear power spectrum, we find that the two effects depend differently on the line-of-sight angle {$\mu$} . Finally, we use the hacc N-body code to quantify errors in the perturbative calculations. For a {$\Lambda$} CDM model at redshift z =1 , our procedure predicts the monopole (quadrupole) to 1\% accuracy up to a wave number 0.19 h /Mpc (0.28 h /Mpc ), compared to 0.08 h /Mpc (0.07 h /Mpc ) for the Kaiser approximation and 0.19 h /Mpc (0.16 h /Mpc ) for the current state-of-the-art perturbation scheme. Our calculation agrees with the simulated redshift-space power spectrum even for neutrino masses above the current bound, and for rapidly evolving dark energy equations of state, |d w /d z {\~|}1 .

  abstract = {Clustering of dark matter halos has been shown to depend on halo  properties beyond mass, such as halo concentration, a phenomenon referred to as halo assembly bias. Standard halo-occupation models (HOD) in large-scale structure studies assume that halo mass alone is sufficient in characterizing the connection between galaxies and halos. Modeling of galaxy clustering can face systematic effects if the number of galaxies within a halo is correlated with other halo properties. Using the Small MultiDark-Planck high-resolution N-body simulation and the clustering measurements of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 main galaxy sample, we investigate the extent to which the concentration dependence of halo occupation can be constrained. Furthermore, we study how allowing for the concentration dependence can improve our modeling of galaxy clustering. Our constraints on HOD with assembly bias suggest that satellite population is not correlated with halo concentration at fixed halo mass. At fixed halo mass, our constraints favor lack of correlation between the occupation of centrals and halo concentration in the most luminous samples (M r {$<$} -21.5, -21), and modest correlation in the M r {$<$} -20.5, -20, -19.5 samples. We show that, in comparison with abundance-matching mock catalogs, our findings suggest qualitatively similar but modest levels of the impact of halo assembly bias on galaxy clustering. The effect is only present in the central occupation and becomes less significant in brighter galaxy samples. Furthermore, by performing model comparison based on information criteria, we find that in most cases, the standard mass-only HOD model is still favored by the observations.},

  abstract = {Upcoming weak lensing surveys, such as LSST, EUCLID and WFIRST, aim to  measure the matter power spectrum with unprecedented accuracy. In order to fully exploit these observations, models are needed that, given a set of cosmological parameters, can predict the non-linear matter power spectrum at the level of 1 per cent or better for scales corresponding to comoving wavenumbers 0.1 {$\lessequivlnt$}k{$\lessequivlnt$} 10 h Mpc-1. We have employed the large suite of simulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project to investigate the effects of various baryonic processes on the matter power spectrum. In addition, we have examined the distribution of power over different mass components, the back-reaction of the baryons on the cold dark matter and the evolution of the dominant effects on the matter power spectrum. We find that single baryonic processes are capable of changing the power spectrum by up to several tens of per cent. Our simulation that includes AGN feedback, which we consider to be our most realistic simulation as, unlike those used in previous studies, it has been shown to solve the overcooling problem and to reproduce optical and X-ray observations of groups of galaxies, predicts a decrease in power relative to a dark matter only simulation ranging, at z= 0, from 1 per cent at k{$\approx$} 0.3 h Mpc-1 to 10 per cent at k{$\approx$} 1 h Mpc-1 and to 30 per cent at k{$\approx$} 10 h Mpc-1. This contradicts the naive view that baryons raise the power through cooling, which is the dominant effect only for k{$\greaterequivlnt$} 70 h Mpc-1. Therefore, baryons, and particularly AGN feedback, cannot be ignored in theoretical power spectra for k{$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.3 h Mpc-1. It will thus be necessary to improve our understanding of feedback processes in galaxy formation, or at least to constrain them through auxiliary observations, before we can fulfil the goals of upcoming weak lensing surveys.},

We conduct a detailed investigation of the dependence of the relative difference between the total matter power spectra in hydrodynamical and collisionless simulations on the effectiveness of stellar and AGN feedback, cosmology, and redshift. The strength of AGN feedback can greatly affect the power on a range of scales, while a lack of stellar feedback can greatly increase the effectiveness of AGN feedback on large scales. We also examine differences in the initial conditions of hydrodynamic and N-body simulations that can lead to an {$\sim$} 1 per cent discrepancy in the large-scale power, and furthermore show our results to be insensitive to cosmic variance. We present an empirical model capable of predicting the effect of galaxy formation on the matter power spectrum at z = 0 to within 1 per cent for k{$<$} 1 h Mpc\^\{-1\}, given only the mean baryon fraction in galaxy groups.

  abstract = {The brightest galaxy in a dark matter halo is expected to reside at rest at the centre of the halo. In this paper, we test this `Central Galaxy Paradigm' (CGP) using group catalogues extracted from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For each group, we compute a parameter , which is defined as the difference between the velocity of the brightest group galaxy and the average velocity of the other group members (hereafter satellites), normalized by the unbiased estimator of the velocity dispersion of the satellite galaxies. Because the redshift surveys suffer from incompleteness effects and the group selection criterion unavoidably selects interlopers, a proper comparison between data and model needs to take this into account. To this extent, we use detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys (MGRSs), which are analysed in exactly the same way as the data, thus allowing for a fair comparison. We show that the CGP is only consistent with the data in haloes with M{$<\sptilde$} 1013h-1 Msolar, while in more massive haloes the data indicate a non-zero offset between the brightest galaxy and the satellites. This indicates that either central galaxies reside at the minimum of the dark matter potential, but that the halo itself is not yet fully relaxed, or, that the halo is relaxed, but that the central galaxy oscillates in its potential well. The former is consistent with the fact that the velocity bias of the brightest halo galaxies is larger in more massive haloes, while the latter may be indicative of cored, rather than cusped, dark matter haloes. We discuss several implications of these findings, including mass estimates based on satellite kinematics, strong gravitational lensing, halo occupation models, and the frequency and longevity of lopsidedness in disc galaxies.},

Cosmologists rely on data where a host of useful information is enclosed, but is encoded in a non-trivial way. The challenges in extracting this information must be overcome to make the most of a large experimental effort. Even after having converged to a standard cosmological model (the LCDM model) we should keep in mind that this model is described by 10 or more physical parameters and if we want to study deviations from it, the number of parameters is even larger. Dealing with such a high dimensional parameter space and finding parameters constraints is a challenge on itself. Cosmologists want to be able to compare and combine different data sets both for testing for possible disagreements (which could indicate new physics) and for improving parameter determinations. Finally, cosmologists in many cases want to find out, before actually doing the experiment, how much one would be able to learn from it. For all these reasons, sophisiticated statistical techniques are being employed in cosmology, and it has become crucial to know some statistical background to understand recent literature in the field. I will introduce some statistical tools that any cosmologist should know about in order to be able to understand recently published results from the analysis of cosmological data sets.

The free-streaming of neutrinos results in a (non-linear) scale-dependent suppression of power spectrum of the total matter distribution at scales probed by Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest data which is larger than the linear theory prediction by about 25 \% and strongly redshift dependent. By extracting a set of realistic mock quasar spectra, we quantify the effect of neutrinos on the flux probability distribution function and flux power spectrum. The differences in the matter power spectra translate into a \textasciitilde{} 2.5\% (5\%) difference in the flux power spectrum for neutrino masses with {$\Sigma$}m\textsubscript{{$\nu$}} = 0.3 eV (0.6 eV). This rather small effect is difficult to detect from present Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest data and nearly perfectly degenerate with the overall amplitude of the matter power spectrum as characterised by {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{8}. If the results of the numerical simulations are normalized to have the same {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{8} in the initial conditions, then neutrinos produce a smaller suppression in the flux power of about 3\% (5\%) for {$\Sigma$}m\textsubscript{{$\nu$}} = 0.6 eV (1.2 eV) when compared to a simulation without neutrinos. We present constraints on neutrino masses using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey flux power spectrum alone and find an upper limit of {$\Sigma$}m\textsubscript{{$\nu$}} \&lt; 0.9 eV (2{$\sigma$} C.L.), comparable to constraints obtained from the cosmic microwave background data or other large scale structure probes.},

Our set of simulations explore the properties of neutrinos in a reference {$\Lambda$}CDM model with total neutrino masses between 0.05-0.60 eV in cold dark matter haloes of mass 10\textsuperscript{11}-10\textsuperscript{15} h\textsuperscript{-1}M\textsubscript{solar}, over a redshift range z = 0-2. We compute the halo mass function and show that it is reasonably well fitted by the Sheth-Tormen formula, once the neutrino contribution to the total matter is removed. More importantly, we focus on the CDM and neutrino properties of the density and peculiar velocity fields in the cosmological volume, inside and in the outskirts of virialized haloes. The dynamical state of the neutrino particles depends strongly on their momentum: whereas neutrinos in the low velocity tail behave similarly to CDM particles, neutrinos in the high velocity tail are not affected by the clustering of the underlying CDM component. We find that the neutrino (linear) unperturbed momentum distribution is modified and mass and redshift dependent deviations from the expected Fermi-Dirac distribution are in place both in the cosmological volume and inside haloes. The neutrino density profiles around virialized haloes have been carefully investigated and a simple fitting formula is provided. The neutrino profile, unlike the cold dark matter one, is found to be cored with core size and central density that depend on the neutrino mass, redshift and mass of the halo, for halos of masses larger than \textasciitilde{} 10\textsuperscript{13.5}h\textsuperscript{-1}M\textsubscript{solar}. For lower masses the neutrino profile is best fitted by a simple power-law relation in the range probed by the simulations. The results we obtain are numerically converged in terms of neutrino profiles at the 10\% level for scales above \textasciitilde{} 200 h\textsuperscript{-1}kpc at z = 0, and are stable with respect to box-size and starting redshift of the simulation.

While on large scales the clustering of matter and CDM+baryons is very different in cosmologies with massive and massless neutrinos, we find that the effect neutrinos have on the clustering of CDM+baryons in redshift space on small scales is almost entirely due to the change in {$\sigma$} 8. We show that the effect of neutrinos on the clustering of halos is very different, on all scales, from the effects induced by varying {$\sigma$} 8. We find that the effects of neutrinos on the growth rate of CDM+baryons ranges from \texttildelow 0.3\% to 2\% on scales k\textbackslash in [0.01,0.5] h \{Mpc\}\vphantom\{\}-1 for neutrinos with masses \{M\}{$\nu$} {$\leq$}slant 0.15 \{eV\}.

We show that, even on very large scales, nonlinear corrections are important to describe the clustering of halos in redshift space in cosmologies with massless and massive neutrinos at low redshift. We find that hydrodynamics and astrophysical processes, as implemented in our simulations, only distort the relative effect that neutrinos induce on the anisotropic clustering of matter, CDM+baryons, and halos in redshift space by less than 1\%. Thus, the effect of neutrinos in the fully nonlinear regime can be written as a transfer function with very weak dependence on astrophysics that can be studied through N-body simulations.},

The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of (106.5 Mpc)3, has a dark mass resolution of 6.26 \texttimes{} 106 M{$\odot$}, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of 1.26 \texttimes{} 106 M{$\odot$}. At z = 0 gravitational forces are softened on scales of 710 pc, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of 48 pc. We follow the dynamical evolution of 2 \texttimes{} 18203 resolution elements and in addition passively evolve 18203 Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than 18 billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. Here we describe the simulation suite, and contrast basic predictions of our model for the present-day galaxy population with observations of the local universe. At z = 0 our simulation volume contains about 40 000 well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at z = 0. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disc galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime, the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

  abstract = {We compute the covariance of the galaxy power spectrum multipoles in perturbation theory, including the effects of nonlinear evolution, nonlinear and nonlocal bias, radial redshift-space distortions, arbitrary survey window and shot noise. We rewrite the power spectrum FKP estimator in terms of the usual windowed galaxy fluctuations and the fluctuations in the number of galaxies inside the survey volume. We show that this leads to a stronger super-sample covariance than assumed in the literature and causes a substantial leakage of Gaussian information. We decompose the covariance matrix into several contributions that provide an insight into its behavior for different biased tracers. We show that for realistic surveys, the covariance of power spectrum multipoles is already dominated by shot noise and super survey mode coupling in the weakly non-linear regime. Both these effects can be accurately modeled analytically, making a perturbative treatment of the covariance very compelling. Our method allows for the covariance to be varied as a function of cosmology and bias parameters very efficiently, with survey geometry entering as fixed kernels that can be computed separately using FFTs. We find excellent agreement between our analytic covariance and that estimated from BOSS DR12 Patchy mock catalogs in the whole range we tested, up to \$k=0.6\$ h/Mpc. This bodes well for application to future surveys such as DESI and Euclid.},

We obtain parameter estimates that agree well with those based on the sample covariance from two thousand galaxy mock catalogs, thus validating the analytic approach and providing substantial reduction in computational cost. We also highlight a number of additional advantages of analytic covariances. First, the analysis does not suffer from sampling noise, which biases the constraints and typically requires inflating parameter error bars. Second, it allows us to study convergence of the cosmological constraints when recomputing the analytic covariances to match the best-fit power spectrum, which can be done at a negligible computational cost, unlike when using mock catalogs. These effects reduce the systematic error budget of cosmological constraints, which suggests that the analytic approach may be an important tool for upcoming high-precision galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid. Finally, we study the impact of various ingredients in the power spectrum covariance matrix and show that the non-Gaussian part, which includes the regular trispectrum and super-sample covariance, has a marginal effect (\$\textbackslash lesssim 10 \textbackslash\%\$) on the cosmological parameter error bars. We also suggest improvements to analytic covariances that are commonly used in Fisher forecasts.},

The fraction of the ejected subhaloes in the total halo population of the same mass ranges from 9 to 4 per cent for halo masses from \textasciitilde 1011 to \textasciitilde 1012h-1Msolar. Most of the ejected subhaloes are distributed within four times the virial radius of their hosts. These ejected subhaloes have distinct velocity distribution around their hosts in comparison to normal haloes. The number of subhaloes ejected from a host of given mass increases with the assembly redshift of the host. Ejected subhaloes in general reside in high-density regions, and have a much higher bias parameter than normal haloes of the same mass. They also have earlier assembly times, so that they contribute to the assembly bias of dark matter haloes seen in cosmological simulations. However, the assembly bias is not dominated by the ejected population, indicating that large-scale environmental effects on normal haloes are the main source for the assembly bias.},

We confirm results that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time at fixed mass and that this trend depends on halo mass. For the first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately parameterized in a simple way: b(M,c|z)=b(M|z)bcvir(c|M/M*). Interestingly, the scaling between bias and concentration changes sign with the value of M/M*: high-concentration (early forming) objects cluster more strongly for M{$<\sptilde$}M*, while low-concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-mass halos, M{$>\sptilde$}M*. We show the first explicit demonstration that host dark halo clustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) at fixed mass and discuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g., low surface brightness dwarfs) should have more slowly rising rotation curves than their more clustered counterparts and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that self-calibrating richness-selected cluster samples with their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias cosmological parameter estimation.},

We analyse the performance of future Dark Energy Task Force (DETF) stage-III and stage- IV dark-energy surveys using supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations and weak lensing as probes. We concentrate in particular on the dark-energy equation of state parameters w0 and wa. For purely geometrical probes, and especially when marginalising over wa, we find considerable disagreement between the two methods, since in this case the Fisher matrix can not reproduce the highly non-elliptical shape of the likelihood function. More quantitatively, the Fisher method underestimates the marginalized errors for purely geometrical probes between 30\%-70\%. For cases including structure formation such as weak lensing, we find that the posterior probability contours from the Fisher matrix estimation are in good agreement with the MCMC contours and the forecasted errors only changing on the 5\% level. We then explore non-linear transformations resulting in physically-motivated parameters and investigate whether these parameterisations exhibit a Gaussian behaviour. We conclude that for the purely geometrical probes and, more generally, in cases where it is not known whether the likelihood is close to Gaussian, the Fisher matrix is not the appropriate tool to produce reliable forecasts.},

However, the galaxy properties predicted from N-body simulations are not necessarily representative of the observed galaxy populations; for example, theoretical uncertainties arise from the absence of baryons in N-body simulations. In this work, we assess how the uncertainties in N-body simulations impact the cosmological parameters inferred from galaxy redshift surveys. Applying the halo model framework, we find that the velocity bias of galaxies in modelling the redshift-space distortions is likely to be the predominant source of systematic bias. For a deep, wide survey like BigBOSS, current 10 per cent uncertainties in the velocity bias limit kmax to 0.14 h Mpc-1. In contrast, we find that the uncertainties related to the density profiles and the galaxy occupation statistics lead to relatively insignificant systematic biases. Therefore, the ability to calibrate the velocity bias accurately - from observations as well as simulations - will likely set the ultimate limit on the smallest length scale that can be used to infer cosmological information from galaxy clustering.},

CLASS measures the large angular scale (1\textdegree{} {$\lessequivlnt$} \texttheta{} {$\leq$} 90\textdegree ) CMB polarization to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio at the r {$\sim$} 0.01 level and the optical depth to last scattering to the sample variance limit. This paper presents the optical characterization of the 40 GHz telescope during its first observation era, from 2016 September to 2018 February. High signal-to-noise observations of the Moon establish the pointing and beam calibration. The telescope boresight pointing variation is {$<$}0\textdegree 023 ({$<$}1.6\% of the beam's full width at half maximum (FWHM)). We estimate beam parameters per detector and in aggregate, as in the CMB survey maps. The aggregate beam has an FWHM of 1\textdegree 579 {$\pm$} 0\textdegree 001 and a solid angle of 838 {$\pm$} 6 {$\mu$}sr, consistent with physical optics simulations. The corresponding beam window function has a sub-percent error per multipole at {$\mathscr{l}$} {$<$} 200. An extended 90\textdegree{} beam map reveals no significant far sidelobes. The observed Moon polarization shows that the instrument polarization angles are consistent with the optical model and that the temperature-to-polarization leakage fraction is {$<$}10-4 (95\% C.L.). We find that the Moon-based results are consistent with measurements of M42, RCW 38, and Tau A from CLASS's CMB survey data. In particular, Tau A measurements establish degree-level precision for instrument polarization angles.},

  abstract = {Understanding the galaxy-halo connection is fundamental for contemporary models of galaxy clustering. The extent to which the haloes' assembly history and environment impact galaxy clustering (a.k.a. galaxy assembly bias; GAB), remains a complex and challenging problem. Using a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, we study the individual contributions of different secondary halo properties to the GAB signal. These are obtained by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass selected samples to that of shuffled samples where the galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of fixed mass and a specified secondary halo property. We explore a large range of internal halo properties and environmental measures. We find that commonly-used properties like the halo age or concentration amount to only 20-30\% of the signal, while the smoothed matter density or the tidal anisotropy can explain the full level of GAB (though care should be given to the specific definition). For the ``successful'' measures, we examine the occupancy variations and the associated changes in the halo occupation function parameters. These are used to create mock catalogues which reproduce the full level of GAB. Finally, we propose a practical modification of the standard halo occupation distribution model, which can be tuned to any level of assembly bias. Fitting the parameters to our semi-analytic model, we demonstrate that the corresponding mock catalogue recovers the target level of GAB as well as the occupancy variations. Our results enable producing realistic mock catalogues and directly inform theoretical modelling of assembly bias and attempts to detect it in the Universe.},

We focus on a Euclid-like survey and consider cosmological models dominated by dark energy and cold dark matter with Gaussian primordial perturbations. After discussing the phenomenology of redshift-space distortions for the bispectrum, we derive an expression for the cross-covariance between B and P at leading order in perturbation theory. Our equation generalizes previous results that did not consider binning in the orientation of wavevector triangles with respect to the line of sight. By considering Fourier modes with wavenumber k{$<$}0.15 h Mpc-1, we find that B and P set similar constraints on the cosmological parameters. Generally, error bars moderately improve when the two probes are combined together. For instance, the joint 68.3 per cent credible region for the parameters that describe a dynamical dark-energy equation of state shrinks by a factor of 2.6 with respect to only using the power spectrum. Regrettably, this improvement is cancelled out when the clustering analysis is combined with priors based on current studies of the cosmic microwave background. In this case, combining B and P does not give any appreciable benefit other than allowing a precise determination of galaxy bias. Finally, we discuss how results depend on the binning strategy for the clustering statistics as well as on the maximum wavenumber. We also show that only considering the bispectrum monopole leads to a significant loss of information.},

  abstract = {We present velocity statistics of galaxies and their biases inferred from the statistics of the underlying dark matter using a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of galaxy formation in low-density and spatially flat ({$\Omega$}0=0.3 and {$\lambda$}0=0.7) cold dark matter cosmogony. Our simulation is based on a particle-particle-particle-mesh (P3M) N-body Poisson solver and smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Galaxies in our simulation are identified as clumps of cold and dense gas particles and classified as young and old galaxies according to their formation epochs. We find that the pairwise velocity dispersion (PVD) of all galaxies is significantly lower than that of the dark matter particles and that the PVD of the young galaxies is lower than that of the old types, and even of all galaxies together, especially at small separations. These results are in reasonable agreement with the recent measurements of PVDs in the Las Campanas redshift survey, the IRAS Point Source Catalogue Redshift Survey, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We also find that the low PVD of young galaxies is due to the effects of dynamical friction as well as the different spatial distribution, while the difference in the PVD between all galaxies and dark matter can be mostly ascribed to their different spatial distributions. We also consider the mean infall velocity and the POTENT density reconstruction that are often used to measure the cosmological parameters, and investigate the effects of spatial bias and dynamical friction. In our simulation, the mean infall velocity of young galaxies is significantly lower than that of all the galaxies or of the old galaxies, and the dynamical bias becomes important on scales less than 3h-1Mpc. The mass density field reconstructed from the velocity field of young galaxies using the POTENT-style method suffers in accuracy from both the spatial bias and the dynamical friction on the smoothing scale of Rs=8h-1Mpc. On the other hand, in the case of Rs=12h-1Mpc, which is typically adopted in the actual POTENT analysis, the density reconstruction based on various tracers of galaxies is reasonably accurate. We also analyze the motions of central galaxies and the velocity dispersion of galaxies within halos and discuss their implications for the motion of cD galaxies and the determination of the mass of galaxy groups.},

The phase-space distribution of the cosmic relic neutrinos is followed, for the first time, by directly integrating the six-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equations. Our novel approach allows us to represent free streaming and clustering of neutrinos, and their gravitational interaction with cold dark matter accurately. We thus obtain solutions for the collisionless dynamics independent of conventional N-body methods. We perform a suite of hybrid N-body/Vlasov simulations with varying the neutrino mass, and systematically examine the dynamical effects of massive neutrinos on large-scale structure formation. Our simulations show characteristic large-scale clustering of the neutrinos and their coherent streaming motions relative to dark matter. The effective local neutrino "temperature" around massive galaxy clusters varies by several percent with respect to the cosmic mean; the neutrinos in clusters can be hotter or colder depending on the neutrino mass. We study a number of statistics of the large-scale structure and of dark matter halos in comparison with those obtained by N-body simulations and/or by perturbation theory. Our simulations mark an important milestone in numerical cosmology, and pave a new way to study cosmic structure formation with massive neutrinos.},

  abstract = {The set-up of the initial conditions in cosmological N-body simulations  is usually implemented by rescaling the desired low-redshift linear power spectrum to the required starting redshift consistently with the Newtonian evolution of the simulation. The implementation of this practical solution requires more care in the context of massive neutrino cosmologies, mainly because of the non-trivial scale-dependence of the linear growth that characterizes these models. In this work, we consider a simple two-fluid, Newtonian approximation for cold dark matter and massive neutrinos perturbations that can reproduce the cold matter linear evolution predicted by Boltzmann codes such as CAMB or CLASS with a 0.1 per cent accuracy or below for all redshift relevant to non-linear structure formation. We use this description, in the first place, to quantify the systematic errors induced by several approximations often assumed in numerical simulations, including the typical set-up of the initial conditions for massive neutrino cosmologies adopted in previous works. We then take advantage of the flexibility of this approach to rescale the late-time linear power spectra to the simulation initial redshift, in order to be as consistent as possible with the dynamics of the N-body code and the approximations it assumes. We implement our method in a public code (REPS rescaled power spectra for initial conditions with massive neutrinos https://github.com/matteozennaro/reps) providing the initial displacements and velocities for cold dark matter and neutrino particles that will allow accurate, I.e. 1 per cent level, numerical simulations for this cosmological scenario.},

We demonstrate that our emulator achieves{\~ }1\% precision at the scales of interest, 0.1 h \textsuperscript{-1} Mpc \&lt; r \&lt; 10 h \textsuperscript{-1} Mpc, and recovers the true cosmology when tested against independent simulations. Our primary parameters of interest are related to the growth rate of structure, f, and its degenerate combination, f{$\sigma$} \textsubscript{8}. Using this emulator, we show that the constraining power on these parameters monotonically increases as smaller scales are included in the analysis, all the way down to 0.1 h \textsuperscript{-1} Mpc. For a BOSS-like survey, the constraints on f{$\sigma$} \textsubscript{8} from r \&lt; 30 h \textsuperscript{-1} Mpc scales alone are nearly a factor of two tighter than those from the fiducial BOSS analysis of redshift-space clustering using perturbation theory at larger scales. The combination of real- and redshift-space clustering allows us to break the degeneracy between f and {$\sigma$} \textsubscript{8}, yielding an 11\% constraint on f alone for a BOSS-like analysis. The current AEMULUS simulations limit this model to surveys of massive galaxies.

  abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between  galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos. The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and a semianalytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more specifically to the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation function M for galaxies above a baryonic mass threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies plus a power law for satellites and that the distribution of satellite numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. Since the number of central galaxies is always zero or one, the width of P(N|M) is narrower than a Poisson distribution at low N and approaches Poisson at high N. For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with M1\textasciitilde 14Mmin (SPH) or M1\textasciitilde 18Mmin (SA). The stellar population age of central galaxies correlates with halo mass, and this correlation explains much of the age dependence of the galaxy HOD. The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a local minimum at M\textasciitilde 10Mmin where halos are too massive to host a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. Using the SA model, we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central galaxies produce a ``bump'' at high masses. We suggest parameterizations for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.},

At both epochs, there is a tight correlation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass, with the slope and scatter decreasing for larger halo masses, and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreases at higher luminosity. We find little evolution in the relation between mass scales of host halos for central galaxies and satellite galaxies above the same luminosity threshold. Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions of the typical growth of halos, we establish an evolutionary connection between the galaxy populations at the two redshifts by linking z\textasciitilde 0 central galaxies to z\textasciitilde 1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos. We find that the stellar mass growth of galaxies depends on halo mass. On average, the majority of the stellar mass in central galaxies residing in z\textasciitilde 0 low-mass halos (\textasciitilde 5\texttimes 1011 h-1 Msolar) and only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high-mass halos (\textasciitilde 1013 h-1 Msolar) result from star formation between z\textasciitilde 1 and z\textasciitilde 0. In addition, the mass scale of halos where the star formation efficiency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass with time. Future work that combines HOD modeling of the clustering of galaxies at different redshifts with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter halos can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.},

  abstract = {The mapping between the distributions of the observed galaxy stellar  mass and the underlying dark matter haloes provides the crucial link from theories of large-scale structure formation to interpreting the complex phenomena of galaxy formation and evolution. We develop a novel statistical method, based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, to solve for this mapping by jointly fitting the galaxy clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The method, called the iHOD model, extracts maximum information from the survey by including \texttildelow 80 per cent more galaxies than the traditional HOD methods, accounting for the incompleteness of the stellar mass samples self-consistently. The derived stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) explains the clustering and lensing of SDSS galaxies over four decades in stellar mass, while successfully predicting the observed stellar mass functions (SMFs). By modelling significantly more galaxies, the iHOD breaks the degeneracy between the logarithmic scatter in the stellar mass at fixed halo mass and the slope of the mean SHMR at high masses, without assuming a strong prior on the scatter and/or using the SMF as an input. We detect a decline of the scatter with halo mass, from 0.22\_\{-0.01\}\^\{+0.02\} dex below 1012 h-1 M{$\odot$} to 0.18 {$\pm$} 0.01 dex at 1014 h-1 M{$\odot$}. The model predicts a departure of satellite SMFs from the Schechter form in massive haloes and a linear scaling of satellite number with halo mass. The iHOD model can be easily applied to other spectroscopic data sets, greatly improving statistical constraints on the SHMR compared to traditional HOD methods within the same survey.},

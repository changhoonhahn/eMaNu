\section{Bispectrum} \label{sec:bk} 
We're interested in breaking parameter degeneracies that limit the constraining 
power on $\smnu$ of two-point clustering analyses using three-point clustering 
statistics --- \emph{i.e.} the bispectrum. In this section, we describe the 
bispectrum estimator used throughout the paper. We focus on the bispectrum monopole 
($\ell = 0$) and use an estimator that exploits Fast Fourier Transpforms (FFTs). 
Our estimator is similar to the estimators described in \cite{scoccimarro2015,sefusatti2016}; 
we also follow their formalism in our description below. Although \cite{sefusatti2016} 
and \cite{scoccimarro2015} respectively describe estimators in redshift- and real-space,  
since we focus on the bispectrum monopole, we note that there is no difference. 

To measure the bispectrum of our halo catalogs, we begin by interpolating the halo
positions to a grid, $\delta({\bfi x})$ and Fourier transforming the grid to get $\delta({\bfi k})$.
We use a fourth-order interpolation to interlaced grids, which has advantageous 
anti-aliasing properties~\citep{hockney1981,sefusatti2016} that allow unbias measurements 
up to the Nyquist frequency. Then using $\delta({\bfi k})$, we measure the bispectrum monopole as 
\beq \label{eq:bk} 
\widehat{B}_{\ell = 0}(k_1,k_2, k_3) = \frac{1}{V_B} \int\limits_{k_1}{\rm d}^3q_1 \int\limits_{k_2}{\rm d}^3q_2 \int\limits_{k_3}{\rm d}^3q_3~\delta_{\rm D}({\bfi q_{123}})~\delta({\bfi q_1})~\delta({\bfi q_2})~\delta({\bfi q_3}) - B^{\rm SN}_{\ell = 0}
\eeq
$\delta_{\rm D}$ above is a Dirac delta function and hence $\delta_{\rm D}({\bfi q_{123}}) = \delta_{\rm D}({\bfi q_1} + {\bfi q_2} + {\bfi q_3})$ 
ensures that the ${\bfi q}_i$ triplet actually form a closed triangle. Each of the integrals 
above represent an integral over a spherical shell in $k$-space with radius $\delta k$ 
centered at ${\bfi k}_i$ --- \emph{i.e.} 
\beq
\int_{k_i}{\rm d}^3q \equiv \int\limits_{k_i-\delta k/2}^{k_i+\delta k/2}{\rm d}q~q^2\int {\rm d}\Omega.
\eeq
$V_B$ is a normalization factor proportional to the number of triplets ${\bfi q_1}$, 
${\bfi q_2}$, and ${\bfi q_3}$ that can be found in the triangle bin defined by 
$k_1$, $k_2$, and $k_3$ with width $\delta k$: 
\beq
V_B = \int\limits_{k_1}{\rm d}^3q_1 \int\limits_{k_2}{\rm d}^3q_2 \int\limits_{k_3}{\rm d}^3q_3~\delta_{\rm D}({\bfi q_{123}})
\eeq
Lastly, $B^{\rm SN}_{\ell=0}$ is the correction for the Poisson shot noise, which 
contributes due to the self-correlation of individual objects: 
\beq \label{eq:bk_sn} 
B^{\rm SN}_{\ell=0}(k_1, k_2, k_3) = \frac{1}{\bar{n}} \big(P_0(k_1) + P_0(k_2) + P_0(k_3) \big) + \frac{1}{\bar{n}^2}. 
\eeq
$\bar{n}$ is the number density of objects (halos) and $P_0$ is the powerspectrum monopole. 

In order to evaluate the integrals in Eq.~\ref{eq:bk}, we take advantage of the plane-wave 
representation of the Dirac delta function and rewrite the equation as
\begin{align} \label{eq:bk2} 
    \widehat{B}_{\ell = 0}(k_1,k_2, k_3) &= \frac{1}{V_B} \int\frac{{\rm d}^3x}{(2\pi)^3} \int\limits_{k_1}{\rm d}^3q_1 \int\limits_{k_2}{\rm d}^3q_2 \int\limits_{k_3}{\rm d}^3q_3~\delta({\bfi q_1})~\delta({\bfi q_2})~\delta({\bfi q_3})~e^{i{\bfi q_{123}}\cdot{\bfi x}} - B^{\rm SN}_{\ell = 0}\\ 
    &= \frac{1}{V_B} \int\frac{{\rm d}^3x}{(2\pi)^3}\prod\limits_{i=1}^{3} I_{k_i}({\bfi x}) - B^{\rm SN}_{\ell = 0} 
\end{align}
where 
\beq
I_{k_i}({\bfi x}) = \int\limits_k {\rm d}^3q~\delta({\bfi q})~e^{i {\bfi q}\cdot{\bfi x}}. 
\eeq
At this point, we measure $\widehat{B}_{\ell = 0}(k_1, k_2, k_3)$ by calcuating the 
$I_{k_i}$s with inverse FFTs and summing over in real space.\footnote{The code that we use to 
evaluate $\widehat{B}_{\ell = 0}$ is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/changhoonhahn/pySpectrum}}
For $\widehat{B}_{\ell = 0}$
measurements throughout the paper, we use $\delta({\bfi x})$ grids with $N_{\rm grid} = 360$ 
and triangle configurations defined by $k_1, k_2, k_3$ bins of width 
$\Delta k = 3 k_f = 0.01885~h/{\rm Mpc}$, three times the fundamental mode
$k_f = 2\pi/(1000~h/{\rm Mpc})$ given the box size. 

We present the redshift-space halo bispectrum of the HADE simulations measured using 
the estimator above in two ways: one that emphasizes the triangle shape dependence 
(Figure~\ref{fig:bk_shape}) and the other that emphasizes the amplitude 
(Figure~\ref{fig:bk_amp}). In Figure~\ref{fig:bk_shape}, we plot $\BOk(k_1, k_2, k_3)$ 
as a function of $k_2/k_1$ and $k_3/k_1$, which describe the triangle configuration shape. 
In each panel, the colormap in each ($k_2/k_1$, $k_3/k_1$) bin is the weighted average $\BOk$ amplitude 
of all triangle configurations in the bin. The upper left bins contain squeezed triangles 
($k_1 = k_2 \gg k_3$); the upper right bins contain equilateral triangles 
($k_1 = k_2 = k_3$); and the bottom center bins contain folded triangles ($k_1 = 2 k_2 = 2 k_3$). 
We include all possible triangle configurations with $k_1, k_2, k_3 < k_{\rm max} = 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$. 
The $\BOk$ in the upper panels are HADES models with $\smnu = 0.0$ (fiducial), $0.06, 0.10$, 
and $0.15\,\mathrm{eV}$; $\BOk$ in the lower panels are  HADES models with $\smnu 0.0$ eV and 
$\sig = 0.822, 0.818$, and $0.807$. The top and bottom panels of the three right-most 
columns have matching $\sig$ values (Section~\ref{sec:hades}).

Next, in Figure~\ref{fig:bk_amp}, we plot $\BOk(k_1, k_2, k_3)$ for all possible triangle 
configurations with $k_1, k_2, k_3 < k_{\rm max} = 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$ where we order the 
configurations by looping through $k_3$ in the inner most loop and $k_1$ in the outer most 
loop with $k_1 \leq k_2 \leq k_3$. In the top panel, we present $\BOk$ of HADES models 
with $\smnu = 0.0, 0.06, 0.10$, and $0.15\,\mathrm{eV}$; in the lower panel, we present 
$\BOk$ of HADES models with $\smnu 0.0$ eV and $\sig = 0.822, 0.818$, and $0.807$. We 
zoom into triangle configurations with $k_1 = 0.113$, $0.226 \leq k_2 \leq 0.283$, 
and $0.283 \leq k_3 \leq 0.377~h/{\rm Mpc}$ in the insets of the panels.

\subsection{$\smnu$ and other Cosmological Parameter Forecasts} \label{sec:forecasts}
We demonstrate in the previous section with the HADES simulations, that 
the bispectrum helps break the $\smnu$--$\sig$ degeneracy, a major 
challenge in precisely constraining $\smnu$ with the power spectrum. 
This establishes the bispectrum as a promising probe for $\smnu$. However, 
we are ultimately interested in determining the constraining power of the 
bispectrum for an analysis that include cosmological parameters beyond 
$\smnu$ and $\sig$--- \emph{i.e.} $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, and $n_s$. The Quijote 
suite of simulations is \emph{specifically} designed to answer this question
through Fisher matrix forecast.

First, the Quijote suite includes $N_{\rm cov} = 15,000$ $N$-body realizations run at a 
fidicial cosmology: $\smnu{=}0.0$eV, $\Om{=}0.3175, \Ob{=}0.049, 
n_s{=}0.9624, h{=}0.6711$, and $\sig=0.834$ (see Table~\ref{tab:sims}. 
This allows us to robustly estimate the covariance matrix of the bispectrum, 
$\bfi{C}$, which has ${\sim}1,800$ triangle configurations 
(Figure~\ref{fig:bk_cov}). Second, the Quijote suite includes $500$ $N$-body 
realizations evaluated at $13$ different cosmologies, each a small step away 
from the fiducial cosmology parameter values along one parameter 
(Section~\ref{sec:hades} and~Table~\ref{tab:sims}). On top of this, we apply 
redshift-space distortions along 3 different directions for these $500$ 
realizations, which then gives us $N_{\rm deriv.} = 1,500$ realizations. 
These realizations allow us to precisely estimate the derivatives of the 
bispectrum with respect to each of the cosmological parameters.

    \caption{Fisher matrix constraints for $\smnu$ and other cosmological parameters

        parameter constraints for the redshift-space halo powerspectrum monopole in blue 
        for comparison. The contours mark the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence interals. 
        We set $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$ for both power spectrum and bispectrum. 
        We include in our forecasts $b'$ and $M_{\rm min}$, a free amplitude scaling 
        factor and halo mass limit, respectively. They serve as a simplistic bias model 
        and we marginalize over them so that our constraints do not include extra 
        constraining power from the difference in bias/number density in the different 
        Quijote cosmologies. The bispectrum {\em substantially} improves constraints on all of the cosmological 
        parameters over the power spectrum. Constraints on $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$
        improve by factors of 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 5.9, and 3.3, respectively. {\em For $\smnu$, the
        bispectrum improves $\sigma_{\smnu}$ from $0.1962$ to $0.0342$ eV --- a factor 
        of ${\sim}6$ improvement over the power spectrum}.}

Since their introduction to cosmology over two decades ago, Fisher Information 
matrices have been ubiquitously used to forecast the constraining power of future 
experiments~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{jungman1996,tegmark1997,dodelson2003,heavens2009,verde2010}. 
Defined as 
\beq 
F_{ij} = - \bigg \langle \frac{\partial^2 \mathrm{ln} \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j} \bigg \rangle,
\eeq
where $\mathcal{L}$ is the likelihood, the Fisher matrix for the bispectrum can 
be written as 
\beq \label{eq:fullfish} 
F_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}~\mathrm{Tr} \Bigg[\bfi{C}^{-1}\parti{\bfi{C}}\bfi{C}^{-1}\partj{\bfi{C}} + \bfi{C}^{-1} \left(\parti{\overline{B}_0}\partj{\overline{B}_0}^T + \parti{\overline{B}_0}^T \partj{\overline{B}_0} \right)\Bigg].
\eeq
Since we assume that the $B_0$ likelihood is Gaussian, including the first 
term in Eq.~\ref{eq:fullfish} runs the risk of incorrectly including information 
from the covariance already included in the mean~\citep{carron2013}. We, therefore,
conservatively neglect the first term and calculate the Fisher matrix, 
\beq \label{eq:fisher}
F_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}~\mathrm{Tr} \Bigg[\bfi{C}^{-1} \left(\parti{\overline{B}_0}\partj{\overline{B}_0}^T + \parti{\overline{B}_0}^T \partj{\overline{B}_0} \right)\Bigg],
\eeq
directly with $\bfi{C}$ and $\partial B_0/\partial \theta_i$ along each cosmological 
parameter from the Quijote simulations. 

For $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$, we estimate 
\beq \label{eq:dbkdt} 
\frac{\partial \overline{B}_0}{\partial \theta_i} \approx \frac{\overline{B}_0(\theta_i^{+})-\overline{B}_0(\theta_i^{-})}{\theta_i^+ - \theta_i^-}, 
\eeq
where $\overline{B}_0(\theta_i^{+})$ and $\overline{B}_0(\theta_i^{-})$ are 
the average bispectrum of the $1,500$ realizations at $\theta^{+}$ and $\theta^{-}$. 
Meanwhile, for $\smnu$, where the fiducial value is 0.0 eV and we cannot have 
negative $\smnu$, we use the Quijote simulations at $\smnu^+$, $\smnu^{++}$, 
$\smnu^{+++}=0.1, 0.2, 0.4$ eV (Table~\ref{tab:sims}) to estimate 
\beq \label{eq:dbkdmnu} 
\frac{\partial \overline{B}_0}{\partial \smnu} \approx \frac{-21\overline{B}_0(\smnu^{\rm fid}) + 
32 \overline{B}_0(\smnu^{+}) - 12 \overline{B}_0(\smnu^{++}) + \overline{B}_0(\smnu^{+++})}{1.2}, 
\eeq
which provides a $\mathcal{O}(\delta \smnu^2)$ order approximation. By using these 
$N$-body simulations, instead of analytic methods (\emph{e.g.} perturbation theory), 
we exploit the accuracy of numerical simulations in the nonlinear regime and rely on 
fewer assumptions and approximations. In fact, \emph{these $N$-body simulation estimated 
derivatives are the key ingredients that enables us to quantify, for the first time, 
the full information content of the redshift-space bispectrum in the non-linear regime}. 
We discuss subtleties of Eq.~\ref{eq:dbkdmnu} bispectrum derivative and tests of 
convegence in Appendix~\ref{sec:numerical}. 

We present the constraints on $\smnu$ and other cosmological parameters 
$\{\Om, \Ob, h, n_s, \sig\}$ derived from the redshift-space halo bispectrum 
Fisher matrix (Eq.~\ref{eq:fisher}) for $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$ 
in Figure~\ref{fig:bk_fish_05}, respectively. 
We include Fisher constraints for the redshift-space halo power spectrum 
monopole with the same $k_{\rm max}$ for comparison (blue). We mark the 
$68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence interals with the contours. We include in our 
Fisher constraints the following nuisance parameters: $b'$, a scaling factor 
on the bispectrum amplitude, and $M_{\rm min}$, the halo mass limit. $b'$ is 
analogous to linear bias. Meanwhile, we choose $M_{\rm min}$ as a nuisance
parameter to address the difference in the number densities among the Quijote
cosmologies, which impacts the derivatives $\partial \overline{B}_0/\partial \theta_i$. 
For instance, the $\sig^{+}$ and $\sig^{-}$ cosmologies have halo 
$\bar{n} = 1.586\times10^{-4}$ and $1.528 \times 10^{-4}(h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$. 
These parameters serve as a simplistic bias model and by marginalizing 
over them we aim to ensure that our Fisher constraints do not include extra 
constraining power from the difference in bias or number density. $b'$ is a 
multiplicative factor so $\partial \overline{B}_0/\partial b' = \overline{B}_0$. 
Meanwhile, we numerically estimate $\partial \overline{B}_0/\partial M_{\rm min}$ 
using $\overline{B}_0$ evaluated at $M^{+}_{\rm min}{=}3.3\times10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ 
and $M^{-}_{\rm min}{=}3.1\times10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$, with all other parameters 
set to the fiducial value. 

The bispectrum {\em substantially} improves constraints on all parameters 
over the power spectrum. For $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$, the 
bispectrum improves the marginalized constraints, $\sigma_\theta$ of $\Om$, 
$\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ by factors of $\sim$3, 4, 5, 6, and 3 over 
the power spectrum. {\em For $\smnu$, the bispectrum improves the constraint 
from $\sigma_{\smnu}{=}~0.1962$ to $0.0342$eV --- a factor of 6 improvement 
over the power spectrum}. We emphasize that this $\sigma_{\smnu}{=}0.0342$eV 
constraint is for the {\em bispectrum alone} and only for a $1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$ 
box. We list the precise marginalized Fisher parameter constraints of both 
cosmological and nuisance parameters for $P_0$ and $B_0$ in Table~\ref{tab:forecast}. 

Even below $k_{\rm max} < 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$, the bispectrum significantly 
improves cosmological parameter constraints. We compare $\sigma_\theta$, 
the marginalized $1\sigma$ constraints of $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, 
and $\smnu$, as a function of $k_{\rm max}$ for $B_0$ (orange) and $P_0$ 
(blue) in Figure~\ref{fig:fish_kmax}. We focus only on the $k_{\rm max}$ range 
where the Fisher forecast is well defined --- \emph{i.e.} more data bins 
than the number of parameters: $k_{\rm max} > 8 k_{\rm f} \approx 0.05~h/{\rm Mpc}$ 
for $P_0$ and $k_{\rm max} > 12 k_{\rm f} \approx 0.075~h/{\rm Mpc}$ for 
$B_0$. Figure~\ref{fig:fish_kmax} reveals that the improvement of the
bispectrum $\sigma_\theta$ over the power spectrum $\sigma_\theta$ is 
larger at higher $k_{\rm max}$. Although limited by the $k_{\rm max}$ range, 
the figure suggests that on large scales ($k_{\rm max}\lesssim 0.1~h/{\rm Mpc}$) 
$P_0$ $\sigma_\theta$ crosses over $B_0$ $\sigma_\theta$ so $P_0$ has more 
constraining power than $B_0$--- as expected on linear scales. On slightly 
larger $k_{\rm max}$, even at $k_{\rm max} = 0.2~h/{\rm Mpc}$, we find that 
the bispectrum substantially improves $\sigma_\theta$ by factors of
$\sim 1.8$, 2.1, 2.6, 2.5, 2.6, and $3.1$ for $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, 
and $\smnu$ respectively.

Our forecasts demonstrate that the bispectrum has significant constraining power 
in the weakly non-linear regime ($k > 0.1~\mpc$) beyond the power spectrum. This constraining power 
comes from the bispectrum breaking degeneracies among the cosmological and 
nuisance parameters. This is evident when we compare the unmarginalized 
constraints from $P_0$ and $B_0$: $1/\sqrt{F_{ii}}$, where $F_{ii}$ is a 
diagonal element of the Fisher matrix. For $k < 0.4~\mpc$, the unmarginalized 
cosntraints from $P_0$ are tighter than those from $B_0$. Yet, once we 
marginalize the constraints over the other parameters, the $B_0$ constraints 
are tigher than $P_0$ for $k > 0.1~\mpc$. The derivatives, 
$\partial B_0/\partial \theta_i$, also shed light on how $B_0$ breaks parameter 
degeneracies. The parameter degeneracies in the $P_0$ forecasts of Figure~\ref{fig:bk_fish_05} 
are consistent with similarities among the shape and scale dependence of 
$P_0$ derivatives $\partial P_0/\partial \theta$. On the other hand, the 
$B_0$ derivatives with respect to the parameters have significant different 
scale and triangle shape dependences. \ch{derivative figure?} 

By exploiting the unprecedented number of $N$-body simulations of the Quijote 
suite, we present for the first time the full information content of the 
redshift-space bispectrum beyond the linear regime. The information content 
of the bispectrum, however, has previously been examined using perturbation 
theory. Previous works, for instance, measure the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
of the bispectrum derived from covariance matrices estimated using perturbation 
theory~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{sefusatti2005, chan2017}. Most recently, \cite{chan2017},
using covariance matrices that include non-Gaussian contributions calibrated with 
$N$-body simulations, find that the cumulative SNR of the halo bispectrum is 
$\sim 30\%$ of the SNR of the halo power spectrum at $k_{\rm max} \sim 0.1~\mpc$ 
and increases to $\sim 40\%$ at $k_{\rm max}\sim 0.35~\mpc$. While these simple 
SNR measurements cannot be easily compared to our Fisher analysis, we note that 
they are loosely consistent with the unmarginalized constraints, where we find 
tighter unmarginalized constraints from $P_0$ than $B_0$ at $k_{\rm max} < 0.4~\mpc$. 
Also, when we measure the the halo power spectrum and bispectrum SNRs using our 
covariance matrices (Figure~\ref{fig:bk_cov}), we find a relation between the 
SNRs consistent with \cite{chan2017}. Beyond the $k$ range of \cite{chan2017} 
($k_{\rm max}>0.35~\mpc$), we find that the SNR of $B_0$ continues to increase 
at higher $k_{\rm max}$ in constract to the $P_0$ SNR, which saturates at 
$k_{\rm max}\sim 0.1~\mpc$. At $k_{\rm max} = 0.75~\mpc$, the largest $k$ we 
probe, the $B_0$ SNR is $\sim75\%$ of the $P_0$ SNR.

Beyond these signal-to-noise calculations, a number of previous works 
quantify the information content of the bispectrum with Fisher 
forecasts~\citep{scoccimarro2004, sefusatti2006, sefusatti2007, song2015, tellarini2016, yamauchi2017a, karagiannis2018, yankelevich2019}. 
While most of these works fix most cosmological parameters and focus soley 
on forecasting constraints of primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{\rm NL}$) and 
bias parameters, \cite{sefusatti2006} and \cite{yankelevich2019} provide 
bispectrum forecasts for full sets of cosmological parameters. In \cite{sefusatti2006}, 
they present likelihood analysis forecasts for $\omega_d$, $\omega_b$, $\OL$, 
$n_s$, $A_s$, $w$, $\tau$. %$\omega_d = \Omega_{\rm cdm}h^2$ and $\omega_b = \Ob h^2$ are the physical dark matter and baryon densities,  $\tau$ is the reionization optical depth, $A_s$ is the primordial amplitude of scalar fluctuations, and $w$ is dark energy equation of state parameter.  
For $\Lambda$CDM, with fixed bias parameters, and $k_{\rm max} = 0.3~\mpc$, 
they find constraints on $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ from WMAP, 
$P_0$, and $B_0$ is a factor of 1.71, 1.3, 1.4, 1.2, and 1.5 tighter 
than constraints from WMAP and $P_0$ alone. In comparison, for 
$k_{\rm max} = 0.3~\mpc$ our $B_0$ constraints are tighter than $P_0$ constraints 
by factors of 2.1, 2.9, 3.5, 3.7, and 3.0. Both \cite{sefusatti2006} and our 
analysis find significantly tighter constraints with the bispectrum. They 
however include the WMAP likelihood in their forecast and only present 
constraints with both $P_0$ and $B_0$. We also emphasize that they use 
perturbation theory bispectrum models, which break down on small scales. 
In a comparison with $N$-body simulations, \cite{lazanu2016} find that 
perturbation theory models of the matter bispectrum deviate by $>5\%$ 
at $k_{\rm max} \gtrsim 0.15~\mpc$. 

Meanwhile, in \cite{yankelevich2019}, they present Fisher forecasts for 
$\Omega_{\rm cdm}$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $A_s$, $w_0$, and $w_0$ for a 
Euclid-like survey~\citep{laureijs2011} in 14 non-overlapping redshift 
bins over $0.65 < z < 2.05$. They use the full redshift-space bispectrum,
rather than just the monopole, and a more sophisticated bias expansion 
than \cite{sefusatti2006} that depend on the tidal field. They use a 
pertrubative model for the bispectrum, which consequently limit their 
forecast to $k_{\rm max} = 0.15~\mpc$. From their forecasts, they find 
similar constraining power on cosmological parameters from $B$ alone as $P$. 
They also find that combining the bispectrum with the power spectrum 
only moderately improves parameter constraints because posterior 
correlations are similar for $P$ and $B$. While this seemingly conflicts 
with the results we present, there are significant differences between our 
forecasts. For instance, their forecasts are at higher redshifts, $z > 0.7$,
where we expect the constraining power of $B$ to be weaker than at $z=0$. 
They also forecast the {\em galaxy} $P$ and $B$ and marginalizes over 
56 nuisance parameters (14 $z$ bins each with 3 bias parameters and 1 
RSD parameter). They also neglect non-Gaussian contributions to the $B$ 
covariance matrix, which substantially impact the constraints especially 
on small scales~\citep{chan2017}. %; for $k_{\rm max} \sim 0.14~\mpc$, neglecting these contributions overestimates the SNR of the bispectrum by a factor of $\sim 3$~\citep{chan2017}. 
Despite differences, \cite{yankelevich2019} find that the constraining 
power of $B$ relative to $P$ increases for higher $k_{\rm max}$, consistent 
with our forecasts as a function of $k_{\rm max}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:fish_kmax}). 
Also, similar to their forecast, for for $k_{\rm max} = 0.15~\mpc$, 
we also find similar posterior correlations between the $P_0$ and $B_0$ 
constraints. At $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$, however, we find significantly 
less correlations~(Figure~\ref{fig:bk_fish_05}). Based on our forecasts, 
at higher $k_{\rm max}$ adding $B_0$ to the analysis improve parameter 
constraints beyond the improvement found in \cite{yankelevich2019}. 

While the various difference between our forecast and previous work 
prevent more thorough comparisons, the main difference is that we 
present the first bispectrum forecasts for a full set of cosmological 
parameters using bispectrum measurements entirely from $N$-body 
simulations. This allows us to go beyond previous perturbation theory 
based forecasts and quantify the full information content of the 
redshift-space bispectrum all the way out to the non-linear regime. 
Moreover, we also present the first bispectrum forecast of cosmological
parameters including neutrinos and demonstrate the potential of the 
bispectrum in constraining $\smnu$. Below, we underline a few caveats 
of our forecasts.

Our forecasts are derived from Fisher matrices. Such forecasts make 
the assumption that the posterior is approximately Gaussian and, as a result, 
they underestimate the constraints for posteriors that are highly 
non-elliptical or asymmetric~\cite{wolz2012}. Fisher matrices also rely 
on the stability, and in our case convergence, of numerical derivatives. 
We examine the stability of the $P_0$ and $B_0$ derivatives with respect 
to $\smnu$ by comparing the derivatives computed using $N$-body simulations 
at three different sets of cosmologies: (1) \{fiducial, $\smnu^{+}$, $\smnu^{++}$, 
and $\smnu^{+++}$\} (Eq.~\ref{eq:dbkdmnu}), (2) \{fiducial, $\smnu^{+}$, 
and $\smnu^{++}$\}, and (3) \{fiducial and $\smnu^{+}$ \}~(Appendix~\ref{sec:numerical}; Figure~\ref{fig:dPBdmnu}). 
Compared to the derivatives derivatives computed with the (1) cosmologies, 
the derivatives with (2) and (3) differ by $\sim 20$ and $\sim 50\%$ for 
both $P_0$ and $B_0$. These differences do not impact the $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, 
$n_s$, and $\sig$ constraints. They do however affect the $\smnu$ constraints; 
but because $P_0$ and $B_0$ derivatives are scaled by the same factor, 
{\em the relative improvement of the $B_0$ constraint over the $P_0$ constraints 
is not impacted}. 
%$\sigma_\smnu = 0.1962$, 0.2385, and 0.3774 eV with $P_0$ and $\sigma_\smnu = 0.0342$, 0.0416, and 0.0657 eV with $B_0$. 

In addition to the stability of the derivatives, because we use $N$-body 
simulations, we test whether the convergence of our covariance matrix and 
derivatives impact our forecasts by varying the number of simulations 
used to estimate them: $N_{\rm cov}$ and $N_{\rm deriv}$, repsectively. 
For $N_{\rm cov}$, we find $< 5\%$ variation in the Fisher matrix elements, 
$F_{i,j}$ for $N_{\rm cov} > 5000$. Meanwhile, the marginalized parameter
constraints, $\sigma_\theta$, vary by $< 1\%$ for $N_{\rm cov} > 12000$. 
When we vary $N_{\rm deriv}$, we find $< 5\%$ variation in the $F_{i,j}$ 
elements and $\sigma_\theta$ for $N_{\rm deriv} > 1200$. 
Since our constraints vary by $< 10\%$ for sufficient $N_{\rm cov}$ and 
$N_{\rm deriv}$, {\em we conclude that the convergence of the covariance matrix 
and derivatives do not impact our forecasts}. We refer readers to 
Apprendix~\ref{sec:numerical} for a more details on the robustness of 
our results to the stability of the derivatives and convergence. 

We argue that the constraining power of the bispectrum and its improvement 
over the power spectrum come from breaking degeneracies among the cosmological 
parameters. However, numerical noise can impact our forecasts when we invert 
the Fisher matrix. Since Planck constrain $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ 
tighter than the $P_0$ and $B_0$ alone (\ch{@paco: citation to planck prior}), 
the elements of the Planck prior matrix are larger than the elements of $P_0$ 
and $B_0$ Fisher matrices. By including Planck priors (\emph{i.e.} adding the 
prior matrix to the Fisher matrix) increases the numerical stability of our 
forecasts. It also reveals whether the bispectrum still improves parameter 
constraints once we include CMB constraints. With Planck priors and $P_0$ to 
$k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$, we derive the following constraints: 
$\sigma_{\Om} = 0.0125$, $\sigma_{\Ob} = 0.0012$, $\sigma_h=0.0086$, 
$\sigma_{n_s}=0.0048$, and $\sigma_{\sig}=0.0194$. 
Including Planck priors expectedly tighten the constraints from $P_0$ alone. 
Meanwhile, with Planck priors and $B_0$ to $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$, we get 
$\sigma_{\Om} = 0.0086$, $\sigma_{\Ob} = 0.0008$, $\sigma_h=0.0006$, 
$\sigma_{n_s}=0.0043$, and $\sigma_{\sig}=0.0085$, 1.5, 1.6, 1.4, 1.1, and 2.3 
times tighter constraints. For $\smnu$, $\sigma_{\smnu} = 0.0802$ eV for $P_0$ 
and $\sigma_{\smnu} = 0.0297$ eV, a factor of 2.7 improvement.  Hence, even with 
Planck priors, $B_0$ improves substantially parameter constraints, especially for 
$\smnu$. This also suggests that the improvement from $B_0$ we find in our 
forecasts are numerically robust. 

So far in our analysis, our forecasts are derived using the power spectrum
and bispectrum in a \emph{periodic box}. We do not consider a realistic 
geometry or radial selection function of actual observations from galaxy 
surveys. A realistic selection function will smooth out the triangle 
configuration dependence and consequently degrade the constraining power 
of the bispectrum. In \cite{sefusatti2005}, for instance, they find that the 
signal-to-noise of the bispectrum is significantly reduced once survey geometry 
is included in their forecast. Survey geometry, however, also degrades the 
signal-to-noise of their power spectrum forecasts. Hence, with the substantial 
improvement in the $\smnu$ constraints of the bispectrum, even with survey 
geometry we expect the bispectrum will significantly improve $\smnu$ constraints 
over the power spectrum. 

We include the nuisance parameter $\mmin$ in our forecasts to address the 
difference in halo number densities among the Quijote cosmologies. Although 
we marginalize over $\mmin$, this may not fully account for the extra 
information from $\bar{n}$ and nonlinear bias leaking into the derivatives. 
To test this, we include extra nuisance parameters, $A_{\rm SN}$, 
$B_{\rm SN}$, $b_2$, and $\gamma_2$, and examine their impact on our forecasts. 
$A_{\rm SN}$ and $B_{\rm SN}$ are multiplicative factors of the first and
second terms of Eq.~\ref{eq:bk_sn}, which we include to account for any 
$\bar{n}$ dependence that may be introduced from the $B_0$ shotnoise correction. 
$b_2$ and $\gamma_2$ are the quadratic bias and nonlocal bias 
parameters~\citep{chan2012, sheth2013} to account for information from 
nonlinear bias. Marginalizing over $b'$, $\mmin$, $A_{\rm SN}$, $B_{\rm SN}$, 
$b_2$ and $\gamma_2$, we obtain the following constraints from $B_0$ 
with $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$:
$\sigma_{\Om} = 0.0129$, $\sigma_{\Ob} = 0.0044$, $\sigma_h=0.0404$, 
$\sigma_{n_s}=0.0455$, $\sigma_{\sig}=0.0228$, and $\sigma_{\smnu}=0.0343$. 
Only constraints on $n_s$ and $\sig$ are broadened from our fiducial 
forecasts, by $27\%$ and $60\%$. Other parameters, especially $\smnu$, 
are not impacted by marginalizing over the extra nuisance parameters. 
As another test to further isolate the impact of the differing $\bar{n}$, 
we calculate derivatives using halo catalogs from Quijote $\theta^{-}$ 
and $\theta^{+}$ cosmologies--- with fixed $\bar{n}$. We similarly find 
no significant impact on the parameter constraints from $B_0$. Forecasts 
using additional nuisance parameters and with fixed $\bar{n}$ derivatives, 
both support the robustness of our forecast. Yet these tests do not 
ensure that our forecast entirely marginalizes over halo bias. 

In this paper, we focus on the halo bispectrum and power spectrum. However,   
constraints on $\smnu$ will ultimately be derived from the distribution of 
galaxies. Besides the cosmological parameters, bias and nuisance parameters 
that allow us to marginalize over galaxy bias need to be incorporated to 
forecast $\smnu$ and other cosmological parameter constraints for the 
galaxy bispectrum. Although we include a \emph{naive} bias model through $b'$ 
and $M_{\rm min}$, and even $b_2$ and $\gamma_2$ in our tests, this is 
insufficient to describe how galaxies trace matter. A more realistic bias model 
such as a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model involve extra parameters 
that describe the distribution of central and satellite galaxies in 
halos~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{zheng2005,leauthaud2012a,tinker2013,zentner2016,vakili2019}. 
We, therefore, refrain from a more exhaustive investigation of the impact of 
halo bias on our results and focus quantifying the constraing power of 
the galaxy bispectrum in the next paper of this series. 

Marginalizing over galaxy bias parameters, will likely reduce the constraining 
power at high $k$. \cite{hand2017}, for instance, find for their 13 parameter 
model only find a 15-30\% improvement in $f\sig$ when they extend their power 
spectrum multipole analysis from $0.2~\mpc$ to $0.4~\mpc$. Furthermore, jointly 
analyzing power spectrum and bispectrum will help break parameter degeneracies 
and improve constraints on cosmological parameters~\citep{sefusatti2006, yankelevich2019}. 
We again emphasize that the constraints we present is for a $1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$ box, 
a substantially volume than upcoming surveys. Thus, even if the constraining 
power at high $k$ is reduced, our forecasts suggest that the bispectrum still 
offers significant improvements over the power spectrum, especially for 
constraining $\smnu$.

\subsection{$\smnu$ and other Cosmological Parameter Forecasts} \label{sec:forecasts}
We demonstrate in the previous section with the HADES simulations, that 
the bispectrum helps break the $\smnu$--$\sig$ degeneracy, a major 
challenge in precisely constraining $\smnu$ with the power spectrum. 
While this establishes the bispectrum as a promising probe for $\smnu$, 
we are ultimately interested in determining the constraining power of the 
bispectrum for an analysis that include cosmological parameters beyond 
$\smnu$ and $\sig$--- \emph{i.e.} $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, and $n_s$. The Quijote 
simulation suite is \emph{specifically} designed to answer this question
through Fisher matrix forecast.

First, the Quijote suite includes $N_{\rm cov} = 15,000$ $N$-body realizations run at a 
fiducial cosmology: $\smnu{=}0.0$eV, $\Om{=}0.3175, \Ob{=}0.049, 
n_s{=}0.9624, h{=}0.6711$, and $\sig{=}0.834$ (see Table~\ref{tab:sims}). 
This allows us to robustly estimate the $1898\times1898$ covariance matrix 
of the {\em full} bispectrum, $\bfi{C}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:bk_cov}). Second, the Quijote 
suite includes $500$ $N$-body realizations evaluated at $13$ different 
cosmologies, each a small step away from the fiducial cosmology parameter 
values along one parameter (Section~\ref{sec:hades} and~Table~\ref{tab:sims}). 
We apply redshift-space distortions along 3 different directions for 
these $500$ realizations, which then effectively gives us $N_{\rm deriv.} = 1,500$ 
realizations. These simulations allow us to precisely estimate the derivatives 
of the bispectrum with respect to each of the cosmological parameters.

    \caption{Fisher matrix constraints for $\smnu$ and other cosmological parameters

        parameter constraints for the redshift-space halo power spectrum monopole and 
        quadrupole in blue for comparison. The contours mark the $68\%$ and $95\%$ 
        confidence intervals.  We set $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$ for both power 
        spectrum and bispectrum. We include in our forecasts $b'$ and $M_{\rm min}$, a 
        free amplitude scaling factor and halo mass limit, respectively. They serve as 
        a simplistic bias model and we marginalize over them so that our constraints do 
        not include extra constraining power from the difference in bias/number density 
        in the different Quijote cosmologies. The bispectrum {\em substantially} 
        improves constraints on all of the cosmological parameters over the power 
        spectrum. Constraints on $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ improve by
        factors of \ch{1.9, 2.6, 3.1, 3.6, and 2.6}, respectively. {\em For $\smnu$, the
        bispectrum improves $\sigma_{\smnu}$ from \ch{0.2968 to 0.0572 eV --- over a
        factor of ${\sim}5$ improvement over the power spectrum}.}}

Since their introduction to cosmology over two decades ago, Fisher information 
matrices have been ubiquitously used to forecast the constraining power of future 
experiments~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{jungman1996,tegmark1997,dodelson2003,heavens2009,verde2010}. 
Defined as 
\beq 
F_{ij} = - \bigg \langle \frac{\partial^2 \mathrm{ln} \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_i \partial \theta_j} \bigg \rangle,
\eeq
where $\mathcal{L}$ is the likelihood, the Fisher matrix for the bispectrum can 
be written as 
\beq \label{eq:fullfish} 
F_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}~\mathrm{Tr} \Bigg[\bfi{C}^{-1}\parti{\bfi{C}}\bfi{C}^{-1}\partj{\bfi{C}} + \bfi{C}^{-1} \left(\parti{B_0}\partj{B_0}^T + \parti{B_0}^T \partj{B_0} \right)\Bigg].
\eeq
Since we assume that the $B_0$ likelihood is Gaussian, including the first 
term in Eq.~\ref{eq:fullfish} runs the risk of incorrectly including information 
from the covariance already included in the mean~\citep{carron2013}. We, therefore,
conservatively neglect the first term and calculate the Fisher matrix as, 
\beq \label{eq:fisher}
F_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}~\mathrm{Tr} \Bigg[\bfi{C}^{-1} \left(\parti{B_0}\partj{B_0}^T + \parti{B_0}^T \partj{B_0} \right)\Bigg],
\eeq
directly with $\bfi{C}$ and $\partial B_0/\partial \theta_i$ along each cosmological 
parameter from the Quijote simulations. 

For $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$, we estimate 
\beq \label{eq:dbkdt} 
\frac{\partial B_0}{\partial \theta_i} \approx \frac{B_0(\theta_i^{+})-B_0(\theta_i^{-})}{\theta_i^+ - \theta_i^-}, 
\eeq
where $B_0(\theta_i^{+})$ and $B_0(\theta_i^{-})$ are the average bispectrum of the 
$1,500$ realizations at $\theta_i^{+}$ and $\theta_i^{-}$, 
respectively. Meanwhile, for $\smnu$, where the fiducial value is 0.0 eV and we 
cannot have negative $\smnu$, we use the Quijote simulations at $\smnu^+$, 
$\smnu^{++}$, 
$\smnu^{+++}=0.1, 0.2, 0.4$ eV (Table~\ref{tab:sims}) to estimate 
\beq \label{eq:dbkdmnu} 
\frac{\partial B_0}{\partial \smnu} \approx \frac{-21 B_0(\theta_{\rm fid}^{\rm ZA}) + 
32 B_0(\smnu^{+}) - 12 B_0(\smnu^{++}) + B_0(\smnu^{+++})}{1.2}, 
\eeq
which provides a $\mathcal{O}(\delta \smnu^2)$ order approximation. 
\ch{
    Since the simulations at $\smnu^+$, $\smnu^{++}$, and $\smnu^{+++}$ are generated 
    from Zel'dovich initial conditions, we use simulations at the fiducial cosmology 
    also generated from Zel'dovich initial conditions ($\theta_{\rm fid}^{\rm ZA}$). 
}
By using these 
$N$-body simulations, instead of analytic methods (\emph{e.g.} perturbation theory), 
we exploit the accuracy of the simulations in the nonlinear regime and rely on fewer 
assumptions and approximations. In fact, these $N$-body simulation estimated 
derivatives are key in enabling us to quantify, for the first time, the total information 
content of the redshift-space bispectrum in the non-linear regime. We present the 
bispectrum derivatives for all triangle configurations in Figure~\ref{fig:bk_deriv} and  
discuss subtleties of the bispectrum derivatives and tests of convergence and stability 
in Appendix~\ref{sec:numerical}. 

We present the constraints on $\smnu$ and other cosmological parameters 
$\{\Om, \Ob, h, n_s, \sig\}$ derived from the redshift-space halo bispectrum 
Fisher matrix for $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:bk_fish_05}. 
We include Fisher constraints for the redshift-space halo power spectrum 
monopole and quadrupole with the same $k_{\rm max}$ for comparison (blue). 
The shaded contours mark the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence intervals. We include 
in our Fisher constraints the following nuisance parameters: $b'$ and $M_{\rm min}$. 
$b'$ is a scaling factor on the bispectrum amplitude, analogous to linear bias. 
And $M_{\rm min}$ is the halo mass limit, which we choose as a nuisance
parameter to address the difference in the number densities among the Quijote
cosmologies, which impacts the derivatives $\partial B_0/\partial \theta_i$. 
For instance, the $\sig^{+}$ and $\sig^{-}$ cosmologies have halo 
$\bar{n} = 1.586\times10^{-4}$ and $1.528 \times 10^{-4}~h^{3}{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$. 
These parameters serve as a simplistic bias model and by marginalizing 
over them we aim to ensure that our Fisher constraints do not include extra 
constraining power from the difference in bias or number density. $b'$ is a 
multiplicative factor so $\partial B_0/\partial b' = B_0$. 
$\partial B_0/\partial M_{\rm min}$, we estimate numerically using 
$B_0$ evaluated at $M^{+}_{\rm min}{=}3.3\times10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ 
and $M^{-}_{\rm min}{=}3.1\times10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ with all other parameters 
set to the fiducial value. 

{\em The bispectrum substantially improves constraints on all parameters 
over the power spectrum.} For $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$, the 
bispectrum tightens the marginalized $1\sigma$ constraints, $\sigma_\theta$, of $\Om$, 
$\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ by factors of $\sim$1.9, 2.6, 3.1, 3.6, 2.6 over 
the power spectrum. {\em For $\smnu$, the bispectrum improves the constraint 
from $\sigma_{\smnu}{=}~0.2968$ to 0.0572 eV --- over a factor of 5 improvement 
over the power spectrum}. This $\sigma_{\smnu}{=}~0.0572$~eV constraint is from 
the {\em bispectrum alone} and only for a $1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$ box. For a larger 
volume, $V$, $\sigma_\theta$ scales as $\propto1/\sqrt{V}$. We list the precise
marginalized Fisher parameter constraints of both cosmological and nuisance 
parameters for $P_\ell$ and $B_0$ in Table~\ref{tab:forecast}. 

Even below $k_{\rm max} < 0.5~h/{\rm Mpc}$, the bispectrum significantly 
improves cosmological parameter constraints. We compare $\sigma_\theta$ 
of $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, and $\smnu$ as a function of $k_{\rm max}$ 
for $B_0$ (orange) and $P_{\ell = 0,2}$ (blue) in Figure~\ref{fig:fish_kmax}. We only 
include the $k_{\rm max}$ range where the Fisher forecast is well defined --- 
\emph{i.e.} more data bins than the number of parameters: $k_{\rm max} > 5~k_{\rm f} \approx 0.03~\mpc$ 
for $P_\ell$ and $k_{\rm max} > 12~k_{\rm f} \approx 0.075~h/{\rm Mpc}$ for 
$B_0$. Figure~\ref{fig:fish_kmax} reveals that the improvement of the
bispectrum $\sigma_\theta$ over the power spectrum $\sigma_\theta$ is 
larger at higher $k_{\rm max}$. Although limited by the $k_{\rm max}$ range, 
the figure suggests that on large scales ($k_{\rm max}\lesssim 0.1~h/{\rm Mpc}$) 
$\sigma_\theta$ of $P_\ell$ crosses over $\sigma_\theta$ of $B_0$ so $P_\ell$ has more 
constraining power than $B_0$, as expected on linear scales. On slightly smaller 
scales, $k_{\rm max} = 0.2~h/{\rm Mpc}$, we find that the bispectrum improves 
$\sigma_\theta$ by factors of 
$\sim 1.3$, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, and 2.8 for $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, 
and $\smnu$ respectively.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Our forecasts demonstrate that the bispectrum has significant constraining power 
beyond the power spectrum in the weakly nonlinear regime ($k > 0.1~\mpc$). 
This constraining power 
comes from the bispectrum breaking degeneracies among the cosmological and 
nuisance parameters. This is evident when we compare the unmarginalized 
constraints from $P_\ell$ and $B_0$: $1/\sqrt{F_{ii}}$ where $F_{ii}$ is a 
diagonal element of the Fisher matrix. For $k < 0.4~\mpc$, the unmarginalized 
constraints from $P_\ell$ are tighter than those from $B_0$. Yet, once we 
marginalize the constraints over the other parameters, the $P_\ell$ constraints 
are degraded and the $B_0$ constraints are tighter for $k > 0.1~\mpc$. The derivatives, 
$\partial B_0/\partial \theta_i$, also shed light on how $B_0$ breaks parameter 
degeneracies. The parameter degeneracies in the $P_\ell$ forecasts of Figure~\ref{fig:bk_fish_05} 
are consistent with similarities in the shape and scale dependence of 
$P_\ell$ derivatives $\partial P_0/\partial \theta$ and $\partial P_2/\partial \theta$. 
On the other hand, the $B_0$ derivatives with respect to the parameters 
have significant different scale and triangle shape dependencies, as seen 
in Figure~\ref{fig:bk_deriv}.

By exploiting the massive number of $N$-body simulations of the Quijote 
suite, we present for the first time the total information content of the 
full redshift-space bispectrum beyond the linear regime. The information content 
of the bispectrum has previously been examined using perturbation 
theory. Previous works, for instance, measure the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
of the bispectrum derived from covariance matrices estimated using perturbation 
theory~\citep{sefusatti2005, sefusatti2006, chan2017}. More recently, \cite{chan2017},
used covariance matrices that include non-Gaussian contributions calibrated with 
$N$-body simulations to find that the cumulative SNR of the halo bispectrum is 
$\sim 30\%$ of the SNR of the halo power spectrum at $k_{\rm max} \sim 0.1~\mpc$ 
and increases to $\sim 40\%$ at $k_{\rm max}\sim 0.35~\mpc$. While these simple 
SNR measurements cannot be easily compared to Fisher analysis~\citep{repp2015, blot2016}, 
we note that they are roughly consistent with the unmarginalized constraints, 
which loosely represent the SNRs of the derivatives. 
Also, when we measure the the halo power spectrum and bispectrum SNRs using our 
covariance matrices (Figure~\ref{fig:bk_cov}), we find a relation between the 
SNRs consistent with \cite{chan2017}. Beyond the $k$ range explored by \cite{chan2017},  
$k_{\rm max}>0.35~\mpc$, we find that the SNR of $B_0$ continues to increase 
at higher $k_{\rm max}$ in constrast to the $P_0$ SNR, which saturates at 
$k_{\rm max}\sim 0.1~\mpc$. At $k_{\rm max} = 0.75~\mpc$, the largest $k$ we 
measure the $B_0$, the SNR of $B_0$ is $\sim75\%$ of the SNR of $P_0$.

Beyond these signal-to-noise calculations, a number of previous works 
have quantified the information content of the bispectrum~\citep{scoccimarro2004, sefusatti2006, sefusatti2007, song2015, tellarini2016, yamauchi2017a, karagiannis2018, yankelevich2019, chudaykin2019}. 
While most of these works fix most cosmological parameters and focus soley 
on forecasting constraints of primordial non-Gaussianity and bias parameters, 
\cite{sefusatti2006}, \cite{yankelevich2019}, and \cite{chudaykin2019} provide 
bispectrum forecasts for full sets of cosmological parameters. In \cite{sefusatti2006}, 
they present likelihood analysis forecasts for $\omega_d$, $\omega_b$, $\OL$, 
$n_s$, $A_s$, $w$, $\tau$. %$\omega_d = \Omega_{\rm cdm}h^2$ and $\omega_b = \Ob h^2$ are the physical dark matter and baryon densities,  $\tau$ is the reionization optical depth, $A_s$ is the primordial amplitude of scalar fluctuations, and $w$ is dark energy equation of state parameter.  
For $\Lambda$CDM, with fixed bias parameters, and $k_{\rm max} = 0.3~\mpc$, 
they find constraints on $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ from WMAP, 
$P_0$, and $B_0$ is $\sim 1.5$ times tighter than constraints from WMAP 
and $P_0$. In comparison, for 
$k_{\rm max} = 0.3~\mpc$ our $B_0$, constraints are tighter than $P_0$ constraints 
by factors of 1.4, 1.7, 2.0, 2.3, 2.0, and 3.9. Both \cite{sefusatti2006} and our 
analysis find significantly tighter constraints with the bispectrum. 
\ch{They however include the WMAP likelihood in their forecast and use 
perturbation theory models, which is limited to larger scales than used 
here~\citep{scoccimarro1998a, scoccimarro1999a, sefusatti2010, pollack2012, gil-marin2014, lazanu2016, eggemeier2019}.
}
%break down on small scales. In a comparison to $N$-body simulations, \cite{lazanu2016} find that perturbation theory models of the matter bispectrum deviate by $>5\%$ at $k_{\rm max} \gtrsim 0.15~\mpc$. 

\cite{yankelevich2019} present Fisher forecasts for $\Omega_{\rm cdm}$, 
$\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $A_s$, $w_0$, and $w_0$ for a 
Euclid-like survey~\citep{laureijs2011} in 14 non-overlapping redshift 
bins over $0.65 < z < 2.05$. They use the full redshift-space bispectrum,
rather than just the monopole, and a more sophisticated bias expansion 
than \cite{sefusatti2006} but use a perturbation theory bispectrum model, 
which consequently limit their forecast to $k_{\rm max} = 0.15~\mpc$. 
They find similar constraining power on cosmological parameters from $B$ 
alone as $P$. They also find that combining the bispectrum with the power 
spectrum only moderately improves parameter constraints because posterior 
correlations are similar for $P$ and $B$. While this seemingly conflicts 
with the results we present, there are significant differences between our 
forecasts. 
\ch{
    For instance, they forecasts the Euclid survey (\emph{i.e.} $z > 0.7$), 
    while our forecasts are for $z = 0$.
}
They also forecast the {\em galaxy} $P$ and $B$ and marginalizes over 
56 nuisance parameters (14 $z$ bins each with 3 bias parameters and 1 
RSD parameter). They also neglect non-Gaussian contributions to the $B$ 
covariance matrix, which 
\ch{play a significant role on small scales~\citep{chan2017} and may 
impact the constraints}.  % for $k_{\rm max} \sim 0.14~\mpc$, neglecting these contributions overestimates the SNR of the bispectrum by a factor of $\sim 3$~\citep{chan2017}. 
Despite differences, \cite{yankelevich2019} find that the constraining 
power of $B$ relative to $P_\ell$ increases for higher $k_{\rm max}$, consistent 
with our forecasts as a function of $k_{\rm max}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:fish_kmax}). 
Also, consistent with their results, for $k_{\rm max} = 0.15~\mpc$, 
we find similar posterior correlations between the $P_\ell$ and $B_0$ 
constraints. At $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$, however, we find the posterior 
correlations are no longer similar, which contribute to the constraining
power of $B_0$~(Figure~\ref{fig:bk_fish_05}).

\ch{
Finally, \cite{chudaykin2019} present power spectrum and bispectrum 
forecasts for $\omega_{\rm cdm}$, $\omega_b$, $h$, $n_s$, $A_s$, $n_s$, 
and $\smnu$ of a Euclid-like survey in 8 non-overlapping redshift bins 
over $0.5 < z < 2.1$. They use
a one-loop perturbation theory model for the redshift-space  power spectrum
multipoles ($\ell = 0, 2, 4$) and a tree-level bispectrum monopole model. 
Also, rather than imposing a $k_{\rm max}$ cutoff to restrict their 
forecasts to scales where their perturbation theory model can be trusted, 
they use a theoretical error covariance model approach from~\cite{baldauf2016} 
and extend down to $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$. They find ${\sim}1.4$, 1.5, 1.2, 1.5, and 
1.3 times tighter constraints from $P_\ell$ and $B_0$ than from 
$P_\ell$ alone. For $\smnu$, they find a factor of 1.4 improvement, from 
0.038 eV to 0.028 eV. Overall, \cite{chudaykin2019} find more modest improvements 
from including $B_0$ than the improvements we find in our $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$ 
$B_0$ constraints over the $P_\ell$ constraints. 

Among the differences from our forecast, most notably, \cite{chudaykin2019}  
marginalize over 64 parameters of their bias model (4 bias and 4 counterterm 
normalization parameters at each redshift bin). They also include the 
Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect for $P_\ell$, which significantly improve the 
$P_\ell$ parameter constraints (\emph{e.g.} tightens $\smnu$ constraints by $\sim30\%$). 
They however, do not include AP effects in $B_0$, which would also improve 
$B_0$ constraints. Furthermore, \cite{chudaykin2019} use theoretical error 
covariance models to extend down to $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$, well beyond 
the accuracy of their tree-level $B_0$ model. Consequently, at $k \gtrsim 0.2~\mpc$ 
these theoretical errors for $B_0$ quickly dominate~\citep[see Figure 1 in][]{chudaykin2019}. 
Hence, their forecasts do not include the significant constraining 
power we find in $B_0$ on nonlinear scales. In addition, the theoretical error 
model they use is derived from the tree-level $B_0$ and is not validated 
against $N$-body simulations. They only validate their theoretical error model 
against the one and two-loop dark matter perturbation theory bispectra, which 
are only marginally more accurate than the tree-level~\citep{lazanu2018}. Also 
different from our analysis, \cite{chudaykin2019} use an Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo 
(MCMC) approach, which derives more accurate parameter constraints than our 
Fisher approach. They, however, neglect non-Gaussian contributions to both 
the $P_\ell$ and $B_0$ covariance matrices and do not include the covariance
between $P_\ell$ and $B_0$ for their joint constraints. Nonetheless, \cite{chudaykin2019} and our 
results both find significant improves in cosmological parameter constraints 
from including $B_0$. In fact, taking the theoretical errors into account, 
the improvements from $B_0$ they find are loosely consistent with our results
at $k_{\rm max} \sim  0.2~\mpc$.

Various differences between our forecast and previous work prevent more 
thorough comparisons. However, crucial aspects of our simulation based 
approach distinguish our forecasts from other works. %Three crucial aspects, however, distinguish our forecasts from other works.
We present the first bispectrum forecasts for a full set of cosmological 
parameters using bispectrum measured entirely from $N$-body simulations.
\ch{
    By using the simulations, we go beyond perturbation theory models and 
    accurately model the redshift-space bispectrum to the nonlinear regime. 
    Furthermore, by exploiting the immense number of simulations, we 
    accurately estimate the full high-dimensional covariance matrix of 
    the bispectrum. With these advantages, we present the first forecast
    of cosmological parameters from the bispectrum down to nonlinear scales
    and demonstrate the constraining power of the bispectrum for $\smnu$. 
}    
Below, we underline a few caveats of our forecasts.
%This allows us to go beyond perturbation theory forecasts and accurately 
%quantify the full information content of the redshift-space bispectrum out to 
%nonlinear regimes. Furthermore, we present the first forecast of the full 
%bispectrum of all 1898 triangles out to $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$, which is 
%only made possible with the immense number ($\sim42,000$) of $N$-body 
%simulations in the Quijote suite. %Lastly, we present the first bispectrum forecast of cosmological parameters that includes neutrinos and demonstrates the constraining power of the bispectrum for $\smnu$. 

Our forecasts are derived from Fisher matrices. Such forecasts make 
the assumption that the posterior is approximately Gaussian and, as a result, 
they underestimate the constraints for posteriors that are highly 
non-elliptical or asymmetric~\citep{wolz2012}. Fisher matrices also rely 
on the stability, and in our case also convergence, of numerical derivatives. 
We examine the stability of the $B_0$ derivatives with respect to $\smnu$ 
by comparing the derivatives computed using $N$-body simulations 
at three different sets of cosmologies: (1) \{$\theta_{\rm fid}^{\rm ZA}$, $\smnu^{+}$, $\smnu^{++}$, 
$\smnu^{+++}$\} (Eq.~\ref{eq:dbkdmnu}), (2) \{$\theta_{\rm fid}^{\rm ZA}$, $\smnu^{+}$, 
$\smnu^{++}$\}, and (3) \{$\theta_{\rm fid}^{\rm ZA}$, $\smnu^{+}$ \}~(see Appendix~\ref{sec:numerical}; Figure~\ref{fig:dPBdmnu}). 
The derivatives computed using the different set of cosmologies, do not impact 
the $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$ constraints. They do however affect the 
$\smnu$ constraints; but because $P_\ell$ and $B_0$ derivatives are affected by 
the same factor, the relative improvement of the $B_0$ $\smnu$ constraint over 
the $P_\ell$ constraints is \emph{not} impacted. 
%$\sigma_\smnu = 0.1962$, 0.2385, and 0.3774 eV with $P_0$ and $\sigma_\smnu = 0.0342$, 0.0416, and 0.0657 eV with $B_0$. 
In addition to the stability, because we use $N$-body simulations, we test 
whether the convergence of our covariance matrix and derivatives impact 
our forecasts by varying the number of simulations 
used to estimate them: $N_{\rm cov}$ and $N_{\rm deriv}$, respectively. 
For $N_{\rm cov}$, we find $< 5\%$ variation in the Fisher matrix elements, 
$F_{ij}$, for $N_{\rm cov} > 5000$ and $< 1\%$ variation in $\sigma_\theta$
for $N_{\rm cov} > 12000$.  For $N_{\rm deriv}$, we find $< 5\%$ variation 
in the $F_{ij}$ elements and $< 5\%$ variation in $\sigma_\theta$ for 
$N_{\rm deriv} > 1200$. Since our constraints vary by $< 10\%$ for sufficient 
$N_{\rm cov}$ and $N_{\rm deriv}$, the convergence of the covariance matrix 
and derivatives do not impact our forecasts to the accuracy level of Fisher 
forecasting. We refer readers to Appendix~\ref{sec:numerical} for a more 
details on the robustness of our results to the stability of the derivatives 
and convergence. 

We argue that the constraining power of the bispectrum and its improvement 
over the power spectrum come from breaking degeneracies among the cosmological 
parameters. However, numerical noise can impact our forecasts when we invert 
the Fisher matrix. Since {\em Planck} constrain $\{\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig\}$ 
tighter than either $P_\ell$ or $B_0$ alone, the elements of the {\em Planck} prior 
matrix are larger than the elements of $P_\ell$ and $B_0$ Fisher matrices. 
Including {\em Planck} priors (\emph{i.e.} adding the prior matrix to the 
Fisher matrix) increases the numerical stability of the matrix inversion. 
It also reveals whether the bispectrum still improves parameter constraints 
once we include CMB constraints. With {\em Planck} priors and $P_\ell$ to 
$k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$, we derive the following constraints: 
$\sigma_{\Om} = 0.0120$, $\sigma_{\Ob} = 0.0012$, $\sigma_h=0.0084$, 
$\sigma_{n_s}=0.0044$, and $\sigma_{\sig}=0.0169$. 
Including {\em Planck} priors expectedly tighten the constraints from $P_\ell$. 
Meanwhile, with {\em Planck} priors and $B_0$ to $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$, we get 
$\sigma_{\Om} = 0.0090$, $\sigma_{\Ob} = 0.0009$, $\sigma_h=0.0064$, 
$\sigma_{n_s}=0.0043$, and $\sigma_{\sig}=0.0104$, 1.3, 1.4, 1.3, 1.0, and 1.6
times tighter constraints. For $\smnu$, $\sigma_{\smnu} = 0.0773$ eV for $P_\ell$ 
and $\sigma_{\smnu} = 0.0430$ eV for $B_0$, a factor of 1.8 improvement. Since we find
substantial improvements in parameter constraints with the {\em Planck} prior, 
the improvement from $B_0$ are numerically robust. Furthermore, $\sigma_\theta$ 
as a function of $k_{\rm max}$ with {\em Planck} priors reveal that while the 
constraining power of $P_\ell$ saturates at $k_{\rm max} = 0.2~\mpc$, the constraining 
power of $B_0$ continues to increase out to $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$ 
(dotted; Figure~\ref{fig:fish_kmax}). 

Our forecasts are derived using the power spectrum and bispectrum in
\emph{periodic boxes}. We do not consider a realistic geometry or radial selection 
function of actual observations from galaxy 
surveys. A realistic selection function will smooth out the triangle 
configuration dependence and consequently degrade the constraining power 
of the bispectrum. In \cite{sefusatti2005}, for instance, they find that the 
signal-to-noise of the bispectrum is significantly reduced once survey geometry 
is included in their forecast. We also do not account for super-sample 
covariance~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{hamilton2006, sefusatti2006, takada2013, li2018}, 
which may also degrade constraints. Survey geometry and super-sample covariance, 
however, also degrades the signal-to-noise of their power spectrum forecasts. 
Hence, with the substantial improvement in the $\smnu$ constraints of the bispectrum, 
even with survey geometry we expect the bispectrum will significantly improve 
$\smnu$ constraints over the power spectrum.  

We include the nuisance parameter $\mmin$ in our forecasts to address the 
difference in halo bias and number densities among the Quijote cosmologies. Although 
we marginalize over $\mmin$, this may not fully account for the extra 
information from $\bar{n}$ and nonlinear bias leaking into the derivatives. 
To test this, we include extra nuisance parameters, $\{A_{\rm SN}$, 
$B_{\rm SN}$, $b_2$, $\gamma_2\}$, and examine their impact on our forecasts. 
$A_{\rm SN}$ and $B_{\rm SN}$ are multiplicative factors of the first and
second terms of Eq.~\ref{eq:bk_sn}, which we include to account for any 
$\bar{n}$ dependence that may be introduced from the shotnoise correction 
(Eq.~\ref{eq:bk_sn}). $b_2$ and $\gamma_2$ are the quadratic bias and nonlocal bias 
parameters~\citep{chan2012, sheth2013} to account for information from 
nonlinear bias. Marginalizing over $b'$, $\mmin$, $A_{\rm SN}$, $B_{\rm SN}$, 
$b_2$ and $\gamma_2$, we obtain the following constraints for $B_0$ 
with $k_{\rm max} = 0.5~\mpc$:
$\sigma_{\Om} = 0.0129$, $\sigma_{\Ob} = 0.0044$, $\sigma_h=0.0404$, 
$\sigma_{n_s}=0.0456$, $\sigma_{\sig}=0.0228$, and $\sigma_{\smnu}=0.0575$. 
While constraints on $n_s$ and $\sig$ are broadened from our fiducial 
forecasts, by $27\%$ and $60\%$, the other parameters, especially $\smnu$, 
are not significantly impacted by marginalizing over the extra nuisance 
parameters. As another test, we calculate derivatives using halo catalogs 
from Quijote $\theta^{-}$ and $\theta^{+}$ cosmologies with fixed $\bar{n}$. 
We similarly find no significant impact on the $B_0$ parameter constraints.
Forecasts using additional nuisance parameters and with fixed $\bar{n}$ 
derivatives, both support the robustness of our forecast. Yet these 
tests do not ensure that our forecast entirely marginalizes over halo bias. 

In this paper, we focus on the halo bispectrum and power spectrum. However,   
constraints on $\smnu$ will ultimately be derived from the distribution of 
galaxies. Besides the cosmological parameters, bias and nuisance parameters 
that allow us to marginalize over galaxy bias need to be incorporated to 
forecast $\smnu$ and other cosmological parameter constraints for the 
galaxy bispectrum. Although we include a \emph{naive} bias model through $b'$ 
and $M_{\rm min}$, and even $b_2$ and $\gamma_2$ in our tests, this is 
insufficient to describe how galaxies trace matter. A more realistic bias model 
such as a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model involve extra parameters 
that describe the distribution of central and satellite galaxies in 
halos~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{zheng2005,leauthaud2012,tinker2013,zentner2016,vakili2019}. 
We, therefore, refrain from a more exhaustive investigation of the impact of 
halo bias on our results and focus quantifying the constraining power of 
the galaxy bispectrum in the next paper of this series. 

Marginalizing over galaxy bias parameters, will likely reduce the constraining 
power at high $k$. \cite{hand2017}, for instance, with their 13 parameter 
model only find a 15-30\% improvement in $f\sig$ when they extend their power 
spectrum multipole analysis from $0.2~\mpc$ to $0.4~\mpc$. However, jointly 
analyzing power spectrum and bispectrum will help break parameter degeneracies 
and improve constraints on cosmological parameters~\citep{sefusatti2006, yankelevich2019, chudaykin2019}.
We again emphasize that the constraints we present is for a $1h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$ box, 
a substantially smaller volume than upcoming surveys. Thus, even if the constraining 
power at high $k$ is reduced, our forecasts suggest that the bispectrum offers 
significant improvements over the power spectrum, especially for constraining $\smnu$.

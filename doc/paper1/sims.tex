\section{HADES and Quijote Simulation Suites} \label{sec:hades} 
The HADES\footnote{https://franciscovillaescusa.github.io/hades.html} and 
Quijote\footnote{https://github.com/franciscovillaescusa/Quijote-simulations}
suites are sets of, 43000 total, $N$-body simulations run on multiple cosmologies,
including those with massive neutrinos ($\smnu > 0$ eV). In this work, 
we use a subset of the HADES and Quijote simulations. Below, we briefly describe these simulations; 
a summary of the simulations can be found in Table~\ref{tab:sims}. 
The HADES simulations start from Zel'dovich approximated initial conditions 
generated at $z=99$ using the~\cite{zennaro2017a} rescaling method and follow 
the gravitational evolution of $N_{\rm cdm}=512^3$ CDM, plus $N_{\nu}=512^3$ 
neutrino particles for $\smnu > 0$ eV cosmologies, to $z=0$. They are run using 
the {\sc GADGET-III} TreePM+SPH code~\citep{springel2005} in a periodic 
$(1~h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ box. All of the HADES simulations share the following 
cosmological parameter values, which are in good agreement with Planck 
constraints~\cite{ade2016a}: $\Om{=}0.3175, \Ob{=}0.049, \OL{=}0.6825, n_s{=}0.9624, h{=}0.6711$, 
and $k_{\rm pivot} = 0.05~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. 

The HADES suite includes $N$-body simulations with degenerate massive neutrinos 
of $\smnu = $ 0.06, 0.10, and 0.15 eV. These simulations are run using the 
``particle method'', where neutrinos are described as a collisionless 
and pressureless fluid and therefore modeled as particles, same as 
CDM~\citep{brandbyge2008,viel2010}. HADES also includes simulations with massless 
neutrino and different values of $\sigma_8$ to examine the $\smnu-\sigma_8$ 
degeneracy. The $\sigma_8$ values in these simulations were chosen to match {\em either} 
$\sigma_8^m$ or $\sigma_8^{c}$ ($\sigma_8$ computed with respect to total matter, 
CDM + baryons + $\nu$, or CDM + baryons) of the massive neutrino simulations: 
$\sigma_8 = 0.822, 0.818, 0.807$, and $0.798$. Each model has $100$ independent 
realizations and we focus on the snapshots saved at $z = 0$. Halos closely 
trace the CDM+baryon field rather than the total matter field and neutrinos 
have negligible contribution to halo masses~\citep[\emph{e.g.}][]{ichiki2012, castorina2014, loverde2014, villaescusa-navarro2014}.
Hence, dark matter halos are identified in each realization using the Friends-of-Friends 
algorithm~\cite[FoF;][]{davis1985} with linking length $b=0.2$ on the CDM + baryon
distribution. We limit the catalogs to halos with masses above 
$M_{\rm lim} = 3.2\times 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\odot$. We refer readers
to~\cite{villaescusa-navarro2018} for more details on the HADES simulations. 

In addition to HADES, we use simulations from the Quijote suite, a
set of 42,000 $N$-body simulations that in total contain more than 8 trillion 
($8\times10^{12}$) particles over a volume of $42000 (h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$. 
These simulations were designed to quantify the information content of 
different cosmological observables using Fisher matrix forecasting 
technique~(Section~\ref{sec:forecasts}). They are therefore constructed to accurately 
calculate the covariance matrices of observables and the derivatives of observables with 
respect to cosmological parameters: 
$\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, and $\smnu$.

To calculate covariance matrices, Quijote includes $N_{\rm cov}{=}15,000$ $N$-body 
simulations at a fiducial cosmology ($\Om{=}0.3175$, $\Ob{=}0.049$, $h{=}0.6711$, 
$n_s{=}0.9624$, $\sig{=}0.834$, and $\smnu{=}0.0$ eV). It also includes sets 
of 500 $N$-body simulations run at different cosmologies where only one parameter 
is varied from the fiducial cosmology at a time for the derivatives. Along $\Om$, 
$\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$, the fiducial cosmology is adjusted by either a 
small step above or below the fiducial value: 
$\{\Om^{+}, \Om^{-}, \Ob^{+}, \Ob^{-}, h^+, h^-, n_s^{+}, n_s^{-}, \sig^{+}, \sig^-\}$ . 
Along $\smnu$, because $\smnu \ge 0.0$ eV and the derivative of certain observable 
with respect to $\smnu$ is noisy, Quijote includes sets of 500 simulations for 
$\smnu = 0.1$, 0.2, and 0.4 eV. Table~\ref{tab:sims} lists the cosmologies included 
in the Quijote suite. 

The initial conditions for all Quijote simulations were generated at $z=127$ using 
2LPT for simulations with massless neutrinos and the Zelâ€™dovich approximation for 
massive neutrinos. The suite also includes a set of simulations at the fiducial 
$\smnu = 0$ eV cosmology with Zel'dovich approximation initial conditions, which 
we use later in Section~\ref{sec:forecasts}. Like HADES, the initial conditions 
of simulations with massive neutrinos take their scale-dependent growth factors/rates 
into account using the \cite{zennaro2017a} method. From the initial conditions, all 
of the simulations follow the gravitational evolution of $512^3$ dark matter particles, 
and $512^3$ neutrino particles for massive neutrino models, to $z=0$ using {\sc Gadget-III}
TreePM+SPH code (same as HADES). Halos are then identified using the same FoF 
scheme and mass limit as HADES. For the fiducial cosmology, the halo catalogs 
have ${\sim}156,000$ halos ($\bar{n} \sim 1.56 \times 10^{-4}~h^3{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$) 
with $\bar{n} P_0(k=0.1)\sim 3.23$.
% The simulations run at the fiducial cosmology for covariance matrix estimation are standard $N$-body simulations. However, the rest are paired fixed simulations, which greatly reduce cosmic variance without introducing bias for a large set of statistics~\citep{angulo2016,pontzen2016,villaescusa-navarro2018}.  We confirm that the paired fixed simulations do not introduce any bias for the redshift-space halo bispectrum (the observable we consider in this paper). 
We refer readers to~\cite{villaescusa-navarro2019} for further details on the Quijote simulations.

    \caption{Impact of $\smnu$ and $\sig$ on the redshift-space halo power 
    spectrum monopole, $P_0$, and quadrupole, $P_2$, of the HADES simulation 
    suite,   
    \edt{
        which includes simulations with $\smnu = 0.0$, 0.06, 0.10, 
        and 0.15 eV (orange, green, and red) as well as massless neutrino 
        simulations with $\sig = 0.822$, 0.818, 0.807, and 0.798 
        (black solid, dashed, dot-dashed, and dotted). $P_\ell$ at 
        each of these cosmology is averaged over 100 $N$-body realizations. 
        While neutrinos suppress small-scale matter power spectrum,  
        the halo $P_\ell$ increases in amplitude with higher $\smnu$ 
        because a lower value of $\sig$ translates into larger halo 
        bias with a fixed halo mass limit. 
    }
    $\smnu$ and $\sig$ produce almost identical effects on halo clustering 
    on small scales ($k > 0.1\hmpc$). This degeneracy can be partially 
    broken through the quadrupole; however, {\em $\smnu$ and $\sig$ 
    produce almost the same effect on two-point clustering --- within a 
    few percent}.

% brief summary of the Quijote suite. 
\section{The Quijote Simulation Suite} \label{sec:sims}
We use a subset of simulations from the Quijote suite, a set of 43,000 $N$-body 
simulations that spans over 7000 cosmological models and contains, at a single 
redshift, over 8.5 trillion particles. The Quijote suite was designed to quantify
the information content of cosmological observables and also to train machine 
learning algorithms. Hence, the suite includes enough realizations to accurately 
estimate the covariance matrices of high-dimensional observables such as the 
bispectrum as well as the derivatives of these observables with respect to 
cosmological parameters: $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, $\sig$, and $\smnu$. For
the derivatives, the suite includes sets of 500 simulations run at different 
cosmologies where only one parameter is varied from the fiducial cosmology  
($\Om{=}0.3175$, $\Ob{=}0.049$, $h{=}0.6711$, $n_s{=}0.9624$, $\sig{=}0.834$, and 
$\smnu{=}0.0$ eV). Along $\Om$, $\Ob$, $h$, $n_s$, and $\sig$, the fiducial 
cosmology is adjusted by either a small step above or below the fiducial value:
$\{\Om^{+}, \Om^{-}, \Ob^{+}, \Ob^{-}, h^+, h^-, n_s^{+}, n_s^{-}, \sig^{+}, \sig^-\}$ . 
Along $\smnu$, because $\smnu \ge 0.0$ eV and the derivative of certain observable 
with respect to $\smnu$ is noisy, Quijote includes sets of 500 simulations for 
$\{\smnu^{+}, \smnu^{++}, \smnu^{+++} \} = \{0.1, 0.2, 0.4~{\rm eV}\}$.

The initial conditions for all the simulations were generated at $z=127$ using 
second-order perturbation theory for simulations with massless neutrinos 
($\smnu = 0.0$ eV) and the Zelâ€™dovich approximation for massive neutrinos 
($\smnu > 0.0$ eV). The initial conditions with massive neutrinos take 
their scale-dependent growth factors/rates into account using the 
\cite{zennaro2017a} method, while for the massless neutrino case we use 
the traditional scale-independent rescaling. From the initial conditions, 
the simulations follow the gravitational evolution of $512^3$ dark matter
particles, and $512^3$ neutrino particles for massive neutrino models, to 
$z=0$ using {\sc Gadget-III} TreePM+SPH code~\citep{springel2005}. 
Simulations with massive neutrinos are run using the ``particle method'', 
where neutrinos are described as a collisionless and pressureless fluid 
and therefore modeled as particles, same as CDM~\citep{brandbyge2008,viel2010}.
Halos are then identified using the Friends-of-Friends algorithm~\citep[FoF;][]{davis1985} 
with linking length $b=0.2$ on the CDM + baryon distribution. We limit 
the halo catalogs to halos with masses above 
$M_{\rm lim} = 3.2\times 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\odot$.
For the fiducial cosmology, the halo catalogs have ${\sim}156,000$ halos 
($\bar{n} \sim 1.56 \times 10^{-4}~h^3{\rm Gpc}^{-3}$) with $\bar{n} P_0(k=0.1)\sim 3.23$. 
We refer readers to Villaescusa-Navarro et al. (in preparation) and Hahn et al. (2019) 
for further details on the Quijote simulations.

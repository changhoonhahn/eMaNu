  abstract = {We develop a higher-order perturbation theory for large-scale structure formation involving a free-streaming hot or warm dark matter species. We focus on the case of mixed cold dark matter and massive neutrinos, although our approach is applicable also to a single warm dark matter species. In order to capture the suppressed growth of neutrino density perturbations on small scales, we account for the full momentum dependence of the phase space distribution using the Vlaslov equation, and derive from it a formal closed-form nonlinear equation for the neutrino density. Using a systematic perturbative expansion of this equation we compute high-order corrections to the neutrino density contrast without the explicit need to track the perturbed neutrino momentum distribution. We calculate the leading-order total matter bispectrum for several neutrino masses. Using our result as a benchmark, we test the accuracy of the fluid approximation and a linear approximation used in perturbative and N-body analyses, as well as a new hybrid approach that combines the exact linear evolution with the nonlinear structure of the fluid equations. Aiming at \$$\backslash$lesssim1\%\$ accuracy, we find that the total matter bispectrum with a low neutrino mass m=0.046 eV can be reproduced by all but the fluid approximation, while for larger neutrino masses m=0.46-0.93 eV only the hybrid approach has the desired accuracy on a large range of scales. This result serves as a cautionary note that approximate nonlinear models of neutrino clustering that reproduce the gross features of some observables may not suffice for precision calculations, nor are they guaranteed to apply to other observables. All of the approximation schemes fail to reproduce the bispectrum of the neutrino density perturbations at better than 20\% accuracy across all scales, indicating that an exact treatment of nonlinear neutrino perturbations is necessary.},

  abstract = {A consistent formulation to incorporate massive neutrinos in the perturbation theory of the effective CDM+baryons fluid is introduced. In this formulation all linear k dependence in the growth functions of CDM+baryons perturbations, as well as all consequent additional mode coupling at higher orders, are taken into account to any desirable accuracy. Our formulation regards the neutrino fraction, which is constant in time after the non-relativistic transition of neutrinos, and much smaller than unity, as the coupling constant of the theory. Then the "bare" perturbations are those in the massless neutrino case when the neutrino fraction vanishes, and we consider the backreaction corrections due to the gravitational coupling of neutrinos. We derive the general equations for the "bare" perturbations, and backrecation corrections. Then, by employing exact time evolution with the proper analytic Green's function we explicitly derive the leading backreaction effect, and find precise agreement at the linear level. We proceed to compute the second order beackreaction correction, and derive the leading order matter bispectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos, suggesting the squeezed limit of the matter bispectrum as a sensitive probe of neutrino mass. Notably, the generic neutrino fraction formulation in this work may be similarly applied for the consistent inclusion of massive neutrinos within any perturbative approach.},

Our neutrino halo model is able to capture the non-linear behavior of matter clustering with a \$$\backslash$sim 20$\backslash$\%\$ accuracy up to very non-linear scales of \$k=10\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc (which would be affected by baryon physics). The largest discrepancies arise in the range \$k=0.5-1\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc where the 1-halo and 2-halo terms are comparable and are present also in a massless neutrino cosmology. However, at scales \$k$<$0.2\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc our neutrino halo model agrees with the results of N-body simulations at the level of 8$\backslash$\% for total neutrino masses of \$$<$0.3\$ eV. We also model the neutrino non-linear density field as a sum of a linear and clustered component and predict the neutrino power spectrum and the cold dark matter-neutrino cross-power spectrum up to \$k=1\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc with \$$\backslash$sim\$ 30$\backslash$\% accuracy. For masses below 0.15 eV the neutrino halo model captures the neutrino induced suppression, casted in terms of matter power ratios between massive and massless scenarios, with a 2$\backslash$\% agreement with the results of N-body/neutrino simulations.

We show that the

We find that hydrodynamics and astrophysical processes, as implemented in our simulations, only distort the relative effect that neutrinos induce on the anisotropic clustering of matter, CDM+baryons, and halos in redshift space by less than 1\%. Thus, the effect of neutrinos in the fully nonlinear regime can be written as a transfer function with very weak dependence on astrophysics that can be studied through N-body

  abstract = {Cosmological measurements of structure are placing increasingly strong constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses, \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$, through Bayesian inference. Because these constraints depend on the choice for the prior probability \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$, we argue that this prior should be motivated by fundamental physical principles rather than the ad hoc choices that are common in the literature. The first step in this direction is to specify the prior directly at the level of the neutrino mass matrix \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$, since this is the parameter appearing in the Lagrangian of the particle physics theory. Thus by specifying a probability distribution over \$M\_$\backslash$nu\$, and by including the known squared mass splittings, we predict a theoretical probability distribution over \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$ that we interpret as a Bayesian prior probability \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$. We find that \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$ peaks close to the smallest \$$\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu\$ allowed by the measured mass splittings, roughly \$0.06 $\backslash$, \{$\backslash$rm eV\}\$ (\$0.1 $\backslash$, \{$\backslash$rm eV\}\$) for normal (inverted) ordering, due to the phenomenon of eigenvalue repulsion in random matrices. We consider three models for neutrino mass generation: Dirac, Majorana, and Majorana via the seesaw mechanism; differences in the predicted priors \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$ allow for the possibility of having indications about the physical origin of neutrino masses once sufficient experimental sensitivity is achieved. We present fitting functions for \$$\backslash$pi($\backslash$Sigma m\_$\backslash$nu)\$, which provide a simple means for applying these priors to cosmological constraints on the neutrino masses or marginalizing over their impact on other cosmological parameters.},

At high redshifts, the new method is able to reduce the shot noise in the neutrino power spectrum by a factor of more than \$10\^7\$ compared to previous methods, where the power spectrum was dominated by shot noise at all scales. We find that our new approach also helps to reduce the noise on the total matter power spectrum on large scales, whereas on small scales the results agree with previous simulations. Our new method also allows for a systematic study of clustering of the low velocity tail of the distribution function of neutrinos. This method also allows for the study of the evolution of the overall velocity distribution as a function of the environment determined by the CDM field.},

  abstract = {The non-zero mass of neutrinos suppresses the growth of cosmic structure on small scales. Since the level of suppression depends on the sum of the masses of the three active neutrino species, the evolution of large-scale structure is a promising tool to constrain the total mass of neutrinos and possibly shed light on the mass hierarchy. In this work, we investigate these effects via a large suite of N-body simulations that include massive neutrinos using an analytic linear-response approximation: the Cosmological Massive Neutrino Simulations (MassiveNuS). The simulations include the effects of radiation on the background expansion, as well as the clustering of neutrinos in response to the nonlinear dark matter evolution. We allow three cosmological parameters to vary: the neutrino mass sum M\_nu in the range of 0-0.6 eV, the total matter density Omega\_m, and the primordial power spectrum amplitude A\_s. The rms density fluctuation in spheres of 8 comoving Mpc/h (sigma\_8) is a derived parameter as a result. Our data products include N-body snapshots, halo catalogues, merger trees, ray- traced galaxy lensing convergence maps for four source redshift planes between z\_s=1-2.5, and ray-traced cosmic microwave background lensing convergence maps. We describe the simulation procedures and code validation in this paper. The data are publicly available at http://columbialensing.org.},

Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the âtree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high
flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

This is the simplest statistics characterising the non-Gaussian properties of the matter and dark matter halos distributions. We investigate, in the first place, the suppression due to massive neutrinos on the matter bispectrum, comparing our measurements with the simplest perturbation theory predictions, finding the approximation of neutrinos contributing at quadratic order in perturbation theory to provide a good fit to the measurements in the simulations. On the other hand, as expected, a linear approximation for neutrino perturbations would lead to O(\$f\_\{$\backslash$nu\}\$) errors on the total matter bispectrum at large scales.

  abstract = {With low redshift probes reaching unprecedented precision, uncertainty of the CMB optical depth is expected to be the limiting factor for future cosmological neutrino mass constraints. In this paper, we discuss to what extent combinations of CMB lensing and galaxy surveys measurements at low redshifts \$z$\backslash$sim 0.5-5\$ will be able to make competitive neutrino mass measurements without relying on any optical depth constraints. We find that the combination of LSST galaxies and CMB-S4 lensing should be able to achieve constraints on the neutrino mass sum of 25meV without optical depth information, an independent measurement that is competitive with or slightly better than the constraint of 30meV possible with CMB-S4 and present-day optical depth measurements. These constraints originate both in structure growth probed by cross-correlation tomography over a wide redshift range as well as, most importantly, the shape of the galaxy power spectrum measured over a large volume. We caution that possible complications such as higher-order biasing and systematic errors in the analysis of high redshift galaxy clustering are only briefly discussed and may be non-negligible. Nevertheless, our results show that new kinds of high-precision neutrino mass measurements at and beyond the present-day optical depth limit may be possible.},

From the \emph{Planck\emph{ temperature data combined with \emph{Planck\emph{ lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, \emph{H\emph{\textsubscript{0\textsubscript{ = (67.8 $\pm$ 0.9) km s\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{Mpc\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{, a matter density parameter $\Omega$\textsubscript{m\textsubscript{ = 0.308 $\pm$ 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with \emph{n\emph{\textsubscript{s\textsubscript{ = 0.968 $\pm$ 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the \emph{Planck\emph{ temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \emph{$\tau$\emph{ = 0.066 $\pm$ 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base $\Lambda$CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining \emph{Planck\emph{ observations with other astrophysical data we find \emph{N\emph{\textsubscript{eff\textsubscript{ = 3.15 $\pm$ 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value \emph{N\emph{\textsubscript{eff\textsubscript{ = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to $\sum$ \emph{m\emph{\textsubscript{\emph{$\nu$\emph{\textsubscript{ $<$ 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | $\Omega$\textsubscript{\emph{K\emph{\textsubscript{ | $<$ 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base $\Lambda$CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of \emph{r\emph{\textsubscript{0.002\textsubscript{$<$ 0.11, consistent with the \emph{Planck\emph{ 2013 results and consistent with the \emph{B\emph{-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and \emph{Planck\emph{ (BKP) data. Adding the BKP \emph{B\emph{-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of \emph{r\emph{\textsubscript{0.002\textsubscript{ $<$ 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a \emph{V\emph{(\emph{$\varphi$\emph{) $\propto$ \emph{$\varphi$\emph{\textsuperscript{2\textsuperscript{ potential. The addition of \emph{Planck\emph{ polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining \emph{Planck\emph{ data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to \emph{w\emph{ = -1.006 $\pm$ 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit \emph{Planck\emph{ base $\Lambda$CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The \emph{Planck\emph{ results for base $\Lambda$CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base $\Lambda$CDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the \emph{Planck\emph{ CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The set-up of the initial conditions in cosmological N-body simulations 
is usually implemented by rescaling the desired low-redshift linear
power spectrum to the required starting redshift consistently with the
Newtonian evolution of the simulation. The implementation of this
practical solution requires more care in the context of massive neutrino
cosmologies, mainly because of the non-trivial scale-dependence of the
linear growth that characterizes these models. In this work, we consider
a simple two-fluid, Newtonian approximation for cold dark matter and
massive neutrinos perturbations that can reproduce the cold matter
linear evolution predicted by Boltzmann codes such as CAMB or CLASS with
a 0.1 per cent accuracy or below for all redshift relevant to non-linear
structure formation. We use this description, in the first place, to
quantify the systematic errors induced by several approximations often
assumed in numerical simulations, including the typical set-up of the
initial conditions for massive neutrino cosmologies adopted in previous
works. We then take advantage of the flexibility of this approach to
rescale the late-time linear power spectra to the simulation initial
redshift, in order to be as consistent as possible with the dynamics of
the N-body code and the approximations it assumes. We implement our
method in a public code (REPS rescaled power spectra for initial
conditions with massive neutrinos https://github.com/matteozennaro/reps)
providing the initial displacements and velocities for cold dark matter
and neutrino particles that will allow accurate, I.e. 1 per cent level,
numerical simulations for this cosmological scenario.},

  abstract = {We present a suite of full hydrodynamical cosmological simulations that 
quantitatively address the impact of neutrinos on the (mildly
non-linear) spatial distribution of matter and in particular on the
neutral hydrogen distribution in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM), which
is responsible for the intervening Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption in quasar
spectra. The free-streaming of neutrinos results in a (non-linear)
scale-dependent suppression of power spectrum of the total matter
distribution at scales probed by Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data which is
larger than the linear theory prediction by about 25 \% and strongly
redshift dependent. By extracting a set of realistic mock quasar
spectra, we quantify the effect of neutrinos on the flux probability
distribution function and flux power spectrum. The differences in the
matter power spectra translate into a \textasciitilde{} 2.5\% (5\%) difference in the flux
power spectrum for neutrino masses with $\Sigma$m$\nu$ = 0.3 eV
(0.6 eV). This rather small effect is difficult to detect from present
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data and nearly perfectly degenerate with the
overall amplitude of the matter power spectrum as characterised by
$\sigma$8. If the results of the numerical simulations are
normalized to have the same $\sigma$8 in the initial
conditions, then neutrinos produce a smaller suppression in the flux
power of about 3\% (5\%) for $\Sigma$m$\nu$ = 0.6 eV (1.2 eV)
when compared to a simulation without neutrinos. We present constraints
on neutrino masses using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey flux power
spectrum alone and find an upper limit of $\Sigma$m$\nu$ $<$
0.9 eV (2$\sigma$ C.L.), comparable to constraints obtained from the
cosmic microwave background data or other large scale structure probes.},

  abstract = {We study the spherical, top-hat collapse model for a mixed dark matter model including cold dark matter (CDM) and massive neutrinos of mass scales ranging from m$\nu\simeq$0.05 to a few 0.1 eV, the
range of lower and upper bounds implied from the neutrino oscillation experiments and the cosmological constraints. To develop this model, we properly take into account relative differences between the density perturbation amplitudes of different components (radiation, baryon, CDM, and neutrinos) around the top-hat CDM overdensity region assuming the adiabatic initial conditions. Furthermore, we solve the linearized Boltzmann hierarchy equations to obtain time evolution of the linearized neutrino perturbations, yet including the effect of nonlinear
gravitational potential due to the nonlinear CDM and baryon
overdensities in the late stage. We find that the presence of massive neutrinos slows down the collapse of CDM (plus baryon) overdensity; however, the neutrinos cannot fully catch up with the nonlinear CDM perturbation due to its large free-streaming velocity for the ranges of neutrino masses and halo masses we consider. We find that, just like CDM models, the collapse time of CDM overdensity is well monitored by the linear theory extrapolated overdensity of CDM plus baryon perturbation, smoothed with a given halo mass scale, if taking into account the suppression effect of the massive neutrinos on the linear growth rate. Using these findings, we argue that the presence of massive neutrinos of mass scales 0.05 or 0.1 eV may cause a significant decrease in the abundance of massive halos compared to the model without the massive neutrinos, e.g., by 25\% or factor 2, respectively, for halos with 1015M$\odot$ and at z=1.},

  abstract = {The abundance of massive dark matter halos hosting galaxy clusters provides an important test of the masses of relic neutrino species. The dominant effect of neutrino mass is to lower the typical amplitude of density perturbations that eventually form halos, but for neutrino masses $\greaterequivlnt$0.4 eV the threshold for halo formation can be changed
significantly as well. We study the spherical collapse model for halo formation in cosmologies with neutrino masses in the range
m$\nu$i=0.05-1 eV and find that halo formation is differently sensitive to $\Omega\nu$ and m$\nu$. That is,
different neutrino hierarchies with a common $\Omega\nu$ are
in principle distinguishable. The added sensitivity to m$\nu$ is small but potentially important for scenarios with heavier sterile neutrinos. Massive neutrinos cause the evolution of density
perturbations to be scale dependent at high redshift which complicates the usual mapping between the collapse threshold and halo abundance. We propose one way of handling this and compute the correction to the halo mass function within this framework. For $\sum$m$\nu$i$\lessequivlnt$0.3
eV, our prescription for the halo abundance is only $\lessequivlnt$15\% different than the standard calculation. However for larger neutrino masses the differences approach 50-100\% which, if verified by simulations, could alter neutrino mass constraints from cluster abundance.},

massive neutrinos as an extra set of particles, with total masses of
0.15, 0.30, and 0.60 eV, we investigate the impact of neutrino masses on
the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes and on the distribution
of galaxies within the haloes. We compute the bias between the spatial
distribution of dark matter haloes and the overall matter and cold dark
matter distributions using statistical tools such as the power spectrum
and the two-point correlation function. Overall we find a
scale-dependent bias on large scales for the cosmologies with massive
neutrinos. In particular, we find that the bias decreases with the
scale, being this effect more important for higher neutrino masses and
at high redshift. However, our results indicate that the
scale-dependence in the bias is reduced if the latter is computed with
respect to the cold dark matter distribution only. We find that the
value of the bias on large scales is reasonably well reproduced by the
Tinker fitting formula once the linear cold dark matter power spectrum
is used, instead of the total matter power spectrum. We also investigate
whether scale-dependent bias really comes from purely neutrino's effect
or from nonlinear gravitational collapse of haloes. For this purpose, we
address the $\Omega\nu$-$\sigma$8 degeneracy and
find that such degeneracy is not perfect, implying that neutrinos
imprint a slight scale dependence on the large-scale bias. Finally, by
using a simple halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, we investigate
the impact of massive neutrinos on the distribution of galaxies within
dark matter haloes. We use the main galaxy sample in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) II Data Release 7 to investigate if the small-scale
galaxy clustering alone can be used to discriminate among different
cosmological models with different neutrino masses. Our results suggest
that different choices of the HOD parameters can reproduce the
observational measurements relatively well, and we quantify the
difference between the values of the HOD parameters between massless and
massive neutrino cosmologies.},

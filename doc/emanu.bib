  shorttitle = {How Are Galaxies Assigned to Halos?},
  abstract = {Clustering of dark matter halos has been shown to depend on halo properties beyond mass such as halo concentration, a phenomenon referred to as halo assembly bias. Standard halo occupation modeling (HOD) in large scale structure studies assumes that halo mass alone is sufficient in characterizing the connection between galaxies and halos. Modeling of galaxy clustering can face systematic effects if the number of galaxies are correlated with other halo properties. Using the Small MultiDark-Planck high resolution \$N\$-body simulation and the measurements of the projected two-point correlation function and the number density of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 main galaxy sample, we investigate the extent to which the dependence of halo occupation on halo concentration can be constrained, and to what extent allowing for this dependence can improve our modeling of galaxy clustering. Given the SDSS clustering data, our constraints on HOD with assembly bias, suggests that satellite population is not correlated with halo concentration at fixed halo mass. Furthermore, in terms of the occupation of centrals at fixed halo mass, our results favor lack of correlation with halo concentration in the most luminous samples (\$M\_\{\textbackslash{}rm r\}{$<$}-21.5,-21\$), modest levels of correlation for \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}rm r\}{$<$}-20.5,-20, -19.5\$ samples, lack of correlation for \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}rm r\}{$<$}-19,-18.5\$ samples, and anti-correlation for the faintest sample \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}rm r\}{$<$}-18\$. We show that in comparison with abundance-matching mock catalogs, our findings suggest qualitatively similar but modest levels of the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering. That is, the effect is only present in the central occupation and becomes less significant in brighter galaxy samples. Furthermore, by performing model comparison based on information criteria, we find that in most cases, the mass-only HOD model is still favored by the observations.},

  abstract = {We show that current surveys have at least as much signal to noise in higher-order statistics as in the power spectrum at weakly nonlinear scales. We discuss how one can use this information to determine the mean of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) using only large-scale information, through galaxy bias parameters determined from the galaxy bispectrum and trispectrum. After introducing an averaged, reasonably fast to evaluate, trispectrum estimator, we show that the expected errors on linear and quadratic bias parameters can be reduced by at least 20-40\%. Also, the inclusion of the trispectrum information, which is sensitive to "three-dimensionality" of structures, helps significantly in constraining the mass dependence of the HOD mean. Our approach depends only on adequate modeling of the abundance and large-scale clustering of halos and thus is independent of details of how galaxies are distributed within halos. This provides a consistency check on the traditional approach of using two-point statistics down to small scales, which necessarily makes more assumptions. We present a detailed forecast of how well our approach can be carried out in the case of the SDSS.},

  abstract = {We constrain the newly-introduced decorated Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model using SDSS DR7 measurements of projected galaxy clustering or r-band luminosity threshold samples. The decorated HOD is a model for the galaxy-halo connection that augments the HOD by allowing for the possibility of galaxy assembly bias: galaxy luminosity may be correlated with dark matter halo properties besides mass, Mvir. We demonstrate that it is not possible to rule out galaxy assembly bias using DR7 measurements of galaxy clustering alone. Moreover, galaxy samples with Mr {$<$} -20 and Mr {$<$} -20.5 favor strong central galaxy assembly bias. These samples prefer scenarios in which high-concentration are more likely to host a central galaxy relative to low-concentration halos of the same mass. We exclude zero assembly bias with high significance for these samples. Satellite galaxy assembly bias is significant for the faintest sample, Mr {$<$} -19. We find no evidence for assembly bias in the Mr {$<$} -21 sample. Assembly bias should be accounted for in galaxy clustering analyses or attempts to exploit galaxy clustering to constrain cosmology. In addition to presenting the first constraints on HOD models that accommodate assembly bias, our analysis includes several improvements over previous analyses of these data. Therefore, our inferences supersede previously-published results even in the case of a standard HOD analysis.},

  abstract = {We develop a higher-order perturbation theory for large-scale structure formation involving a free-streaming hot or warm dark matter species. We focus on the case of mixed cold dark matter and massive neutrinos, although our approach is applicable also to a single warm dark matter species. In order to capture the suppressed growth of neutrino density perturbations on small scales, we account for the full momentum dependence of the phase space distribution using the Vlaslov equation, and derive from it a formal closed-form nonlinear equation for the neutrino density. Using a systematic perturbative expansion of this equation we compute high-order corrections to the neutrino density contrast without the explicit need to track the perturbed neutrino momentum distribution. We calculate the leading-order total matter bispectrum for several neutrino masses. Using our result as a benchmark, we test the accuracy of the fluid approximation and a linear approximation used in perturbative and N-body analyses, as well as a new hybrid approach that combines the exact linear evolution with the nonlinear structure of the fluid equations. Aiming at \$\textbackslash{}lesssim1\%\$ accuracy, we find that the total matter bispectrum with a low neutrino mass m=0.046 eV can be reproduced by all but the fluid approximation, while for larger neutrino masses m=0.46-0.93 eV only the hybrid approach has the desired accuracy on a large range of scales. This result serves as a cautionary note that approximate nonlinear models of neutrino clustering that reproduce the gross features of some observables may not suffice for precision calculations, nor are they guaranteed to apply to other observables. All of the approximation schemes fail to reproduce the bispectrum of the neutrino density perturbations at better than 20\% accuracy across all scales, indicating that an exact treatment of nonlinear neutrino perturbations is necessary.},

  abstract = {A consistent formulation to incorporate massive neutrinos in the perturbation theory of the effective CDM+baryons fluid is introduced. In this formulation all linear k dependence in the growth functions of CDM+baryons perturbations, as well as all consequent additional mode coupling at higher orders, are taken into account to any desirable accuracy. Our formulation regards the neutrino fraction, which is constant in time after the non-relativistic transition of neutrinos, and much smaller than unity, as the coupling constant of the theory. Then the "bare" perturbations are those in the massless neutrino case when the neutrino fraction vanishes, and we consider the backreaction corrections due to the gravitational coupling of neutrinos. We derive the general equations for the "bare" perturbations, and backrecation corrections. Then, by employing exact time evolution with the proper analytic Green's function we explicitly derive the leading backreaction effect, and find precise agreement at the linear level. We proceed to compute the second order beackreaction correction, and derive the leading order matter bispectrum in the presence of massive neutrinos, suggesting the squeezed limit of the matter bispectrum as a sensitive probe of neutrino mass. Notably, the generic neutrino fraction formulation in this work may be similarly applied for the consistent inclusion of massive neutrinos within any perturbative approach.},

Even though the assumption of a Gaussian likelihood is motivated by the central limit theorem, we discuss that it leads to Fisher information content that violates the Cram\textbackslash{}'er-Rao bound if used consistently, owing to independent but artificial information from the parameter-dependent covariance matrix. At any fixed multipole, this artificial term is shown to become dominant in the case of a large number of correlated fields. While the distribution of the estimators does indeed tend to a Gaussian with a large number of modes, it is shown, however, that its Fisher information content does not, in the sense that their covariance matrix never carries independent information content, precisely because of the non-Gaussian shape of the distribution. In this light, we discuss the use of parameter-dependent covariance matrices with Gaussian likelihoods for parameter inference from two-point statistics. As a rule of thumb, Gaussian likelihoods should always be used with a covariance matrix fixed in parameter space, since only this guarantees that conservative information content is assigned to the observables, and at the same time prevents biases appearing.},

We construct estimators for radial distortions that, using only Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of the overdensity field multipoles for a given survey geometry, compute the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole, and generalize such estimators to the bispectrum. Using realistic mock catalogs we compare the signal to noise of two estimators for the power spectrum hexadecapole that require different number of FFTs and measure the bispectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole. The resulting algorithm is very efficient, e.g. for the BOSS survey requires about three minutes for \$\textbackslash{}ell=0,2,4\$ power spectra for scales up to \$k=0.3\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc and about fifteen additional minutes for \$\textbackslash{}ell=0,2,4\$ bispectra for all scales and triangle shapes up to \$k=0.2\textasciitilde{}h/\$Mpc on a single core.

  abstract = {Efficient estimators of Fourier-space statistics for large number of objects rely on fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), which are affected by aliasing from unresolved small-scale modes due to the finite FFT grid. Aliasing takes the form of a sum over images, each of them corresponding to the Fourier content displaced by increasing multiples of the sampling frequency of the grid. These spurious contributions limit the accuracy in the estimation of Fourier-space statistics, and are typically ameliorated by simultaneously increasing grid size and discarding high-frequency modes. This results in inefficient estimates for e.g. the power spectrum when desired systematic biases are well under per cent level. We show that using interlaced grids removes odd images, which include the dominant contribution to aliasing. In addition, we discuss the choice of interpolation kernel used to define density perturbations on the FFT grid and demonstrate that using higher order interpolation kernels than the standard Cloud-In-Cell algorithm results in significant reduction of the remaining images. We show that combining fourth-order interpolation with interlacing gives very accurate Fourier amplitudes and phases of density perturbations. This results in power spectrum and bispectrum estimates that have systematic biases below 0.01 per cent all the way to the Nyquist frequency of the grid, thus maximizing the use of unbiased Fourier coefficients for a given grid size and greatly reducing systematics for applications to large cosmological data sets.},

of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy
number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for
scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables
simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework.
Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift
evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from z = 0.2 to z
= 1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh
vpropM 0.46 * and that this scaling does not
evolve significantly with redshift from z = 0.2 to z = 1. The slope of
the SHMR rises sharply at M * {$>$} 5 \texttimes{} 1010
M {$\odot$} and as a consequence, the stellar mass of a central
galaxy becomes a poor tracer of its parent halo mass. We show that the
dark-to-stellar ratio, Mh /M *, varies from low to
high masses, reaching a minimum of Mh /M * \textasciitilde{} 27 at
M * = 4.5 \texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} and
Mh = 1.2 \texttimes{} 1012 M {$\odot$}. This
minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the
mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has
been the most efficient. We describe the SHMR at this minimum in terms
of the "pivot stellar mass," M piv *, the "pivot
halo mass," M piv h , and the "pivot ratio,"
(Mh /M *)piv. Thanks to a homogeneous
analysis of a single data set spanning a large redshift range, we report
the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both M piv
 h and M piv *. The pivot stellar mass
decreases from M piv * = 5.75 {$\pm$} 0.13
\texttimes{} 1010 M {$\odot$} at z = 0.88 to M
piv * = 3.55 {$\pm$} 0.17 \texttimes{} 1010
M {$\odot$} at z = 0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding
evolution of M piv h leaves the pivot ratio
constant with redshift at (Mh /M *)piv
\textasciitilde{} 27. We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the
possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on
Mh /M * and not simply on Mh , as is
commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence
naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular
quenching models, including disk instabilities and active galactic
nucleus feedback.

  title = {Neutrino {{Mass Priors}} for {{Cosmology}} from {{Random Matrices}}},
  abstract = {Cosmological measurements of structure are placing increasingly strong constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses, \$\textbackslash{}Sigma m\_\textbackslash{}nu\$, through Bayesian inference. Because these constraints depend on the choice for the prior probability \$\textbackslash{}pi(\textbackslash{}Sigma m\_\textbackslash{}nu)\$, we argue that this prior should be motivated by fundamental physical principles rather than the ad hoc choices that are common in the literature. The first step in this direction is to specify the prior directly at the level of the neutrino mass matrix \$M\_\textbackslash{}nu\$, since this is the parameter appearing in the Lagrangian of the particle physics theory. Thus by specifying a probability distribution over \$M\_\textbackslash{}nu\$, and by including the known squared mass splittings, we predict a theoretical probability distribution over \$\textbackslash{}Sigma m\_\textbackslash{}nu\$ that we interpret as a Bayesian prior probability \$\textbackslash{}pi(\textbackslash{}Sigma m\_\textbackslash{}nu)\$. We find that \$\textbackslash{}pi(\textbackslash{}Sigma m\_\textbackslash{}nu)\$ peaks close to the smallest \$\textbackslash{}Sigma m\_\textbackslash{}nu\$ allowed by the measured mass splittings, roughly \$0.06 \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash{}rm eV\}\$ (\$0.1 \textbackslash, \{\textbackslash{}rm eV\}\$) for normal (inverted) ordering, due to the phenomenon of eigenvalue repulsion in random matrices. We consider three models for neutrino mass generation: Dirac, Majorana, and Majorana via the seesaw mechanism; differences in the predicted priors \$\textbackslash{}pi(\textbackslash{}Sigma m\_\textbackslash{}nu)\$ allow for the possibility of having indications about the physical origin of neutrino masses once sufficient experimental sensitivity is achieved. We present fitting functions for \$\textbackslash{}pi(\textbackslash{}Sigma m\_\textbackslash{}nu)\$, which provide a simple means for applying these priors to cosmological constraints on the neutrino masses or marginalizing over their impact on other cosmological parameters.},

It allows us to accurately follow the density field for both Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and neutrinos at both high and low redshifts. At high redshifts, the new method is able to reduce the shot noise in the neutrino power spectrum by a factor of more than \$10\^7\$ compared to previous methods, where the power spectrum was dominated by shot noise at all scales. We find that our new approach also helps to reduce the noise on the total matter power spectrum on large scales, whereas on small scales the results agree with previous simulations. Our new method also allows for a systematic study of clustering of the low velocity tail of the distribution function of neutrinos. This method also allows for the study of the evolution of the overall velocity distribution as a function of the environment determined by the CDM field.},

  abstract = {The non-zero mass of neutrinos suppresses the growth of cosmic structure on small scales. Since the level of suppression depends on the sum of the masses of the three active neutrino species, the evolution of large-scale structure is a promising tool to constrain the total mass of neutrinos and possibly shed light on the mass hierarchy. In this work, we investigate these effects via a large suite of N-body simulations that include massive neutrinos using an analytic linear-response approximation: the Cosmological Massive Neutrino Simulations (MassiveNuS). The simulations include the effects of radiation on the background expansion, as well as the clustering of neutrinos in response to the nonlinear dark matter evolution. We allow three cosmological parameters to vary: the neutrino mass sum M\_nu in the range of 0-0.6 eV, the total matter density Omega\_m, and the primordial power spectrum amplitude A\_s. The rms density fluctuation in spheres of 8 comoving Mpc/h (sigma\_8) is a derived parameter as a result. Our data products include N-body snapshots, halo catalogues, merger trees, ray- traced galaxy lensing convergence maps for four source redshift planes between z\_s=1-2.5, and ray-traced cosmic microwave background lensing convergence maps. We describe the simulation procedures and code validation in this paper. The data are publicly available at http://columbialensing.org.},

  abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high
flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

Analysis of halo bias yields similar conclusions: when large-scale halo

result is both more universal, and less scale- or k-dependent. These
results are used extensively in Papers I and III of this series.},

Such effect is of particular importance as it allows to constraint the value of the sum of neutrino masses from measurements of the galaxy power spectrum. In this work, we present the first measurements of the next higher-order correlation function, the bispectrum, from N-body simulations that include massive neutrinos as particles. This is the simplest statistics characterising the non-Gaussian properties of the matter and dark matter halos distributions. We investigate, in the first place, the suppression due to massive neutrinos on the matter bispectrum, comparing our measurements with the simplest perturbation theory predictions, finding the approximation of neutrinos contributing at quadratic order in perturbation theory to provide a good fit to the measurements in the simulations. On the other hand, as expected, a linear approximation for neutrino perturbations would lead to O(\$f\_\{\textbackslash{}nu\}\$) errors on the total matter bispectrum at large scales. We then attempt an extension of previous results on the universality of linear halo bias in neutrino cosmologies, to non-linear and non-local corrections finding consistent results with the power spectrum analysis.},

  abstract = {With low redshift probes reaching unprecedented precision, uncertainty of the CMB optical depth is expected to be the limiting factor for future cosmological neutrino mass constraints. In this paper, we discuss to what extent combinations of CMB lensing and galaxy surveys measurements at low redshifts \$z\textbackslash{}sim 0.5-5\$ will be able to make competitive neutrino mass measurements without relying on any optical depth constraints. We find that the combination of LSST galaxies and CMB-S4 lensing should be able to achieve constraints on the neutrino mass sum of 25meV without optical depth information, an independent measurement that is competitive with or slightly better than the constraint of 30meV possible with CMB-S4 and present-day optical depth measurements. These constraints originate both in structure growth probed by cross-correlation tomography over a wide redshift range as well as, most importantly, the shape of the galaxy power spectrum measured over a large volume. We caution that possible complications such as higher-order biasing and systematic errors in the analysis of high redshift galaxy clustering are only briefly discussed and may be non-negligible. Nevertheless, our results show that new kinds of high-precision neutrino mass measurements at and beyond the present-day optical depth limit may be possible.},

This additional information will enable us to understand the physics underlying the dark universe at an even deeper level and, in case Stage IV surveys find hints for physics beyond the current Standard Model of Cosmology, to revolutionize our current view of the universe. There are many ideas for how best to supplement and aid DESI and LSST in order to access some of this remaining information and how surveys beyond Stage IV can fully exploit this regime.

  abstract = {The advent of large data-set in cosmology has meant that in the past 10 or 20 years our knowledge and understanding of the Universe has changed not only quantitatively but also, and most importantly, qualitatively. Cosmologists rely on data where a host of useful information is enclosed, but is encoded in a non-trivial way. The challenges in extracting this information must be overcome to make the most of a large experimental effort. Even after having converged to a standard cosmological model (the LCDM model) we should keep in mind that this model is described by 10 or more physical parameters and if we want to study deviations from it, the number of parameters is even larger. Dealing with such a high dimensional parameter space and finding parameters constraints is a challenge on itself. Cosmologists want to be able to compare and combine different data sets both for testing for possible disagreements (which could indicate new physics) and for improving parameter determinations. Finally, cosmologists in many cases want to find out, before actually doing the experiment, how much one would be able to learn from it. For all these reasons, sophisiticated statistical techniques are being employed in cosmology, and it has become crucial to know some statistical background to understand recent literature in the field. I will introduce some statistical tools that any cosmologist should know about in order to be able to understand recently published results from the analysis of cosmological data sets. I will not present a complete and rigorous introduction to statistics as there are several good books which are reported in the references. The reader should refer to those.},

We outline numerical methods for estimating parameters from data, including Monte Carlo Markov Chains and the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method.

Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the \emph{Planck\emph{ nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ``base {$\Lambda$}CDM'' in this paper). From the \emph{Planck\emph{ temperature data combined with \emph{Planck\emph{ lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, \emph{H\emph{\textsubscript{0\textsubscript{ = (67.8 {$\pm$} 0.9) km s\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{Mpc\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{, a matter density parameter {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m\textsubscript{ = 0.308 {$\pm$} 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with \emph{n\emph{\textsubscript{s\textsubscript{ = 0.968 {$\pm$} 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the \emph{Planck\emph{ temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \emph{{$\tau$}\emph{ = 0.066 {$\pm$} 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base {$\Lambda$}CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining \emph{Planck\emph{ observations with other astrophysical data we find \emph{N\emph{\textsubscript{eff\textsubscript{ = 3.15 {$\pm$} 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value \emph{N\emph{\textsubscript{eff\textsubscript{ = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {$\sum$} \emph{m\emph{\textsubscript{\emph{{$\nu$}\emph{\textsubscript{ {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{\emph{K\emph{\textsubscript{ | {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base {$\Lambda$}CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of \emph{r\emph{\textsubscript{0.002\textsubscript{{$<$} 0.11, consistent with the \emph{Planck\emph{ 2013 results and consistent with the \emph{B\emph{-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and \emph{Planck\emph{ (BKP) data. Adding the BKP \emph{B\emph{-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of \emph{r\emph{\textsubscript{0.002\textsubscript{ {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a \emph{V\emph{(\emph{{$\varphi$}\emph{) {$\propto$} \emph{{$\varphi$}\emph{\textsuperscript{2\textsuperscript{ potential. The addition of \emph{Planck\emph{ polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining \emph{Planck\emph{ data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to \emph{w\emph{ = -1.006 {$\pm$} 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit \emph{Planck\emph{ base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The \emph{Planck\emph{ results for base {$\Lambda$}CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology.

  abstract = {The set-up of the initial conditions in cosmological N-body simulations 
is usually implemented by rescaling the desired low-redshift linear
power spectrum to the required starting redshift consistently with the
Newtonian evolution of the simulation. The implementation of this
practical solution requires more care in the context of massive neutrino
cosmologies, mainly because of the non-trivial scale-dependence of the
linear growth that characterizes these models. In this work, we consider
a simple two-fluid, Newtonian approximation for cold dark matter and
massive neutrinos perturbations that can reproduce the cold matter
linear evolution predicted by Boltzmann codes such as CAMB or CLASS with
a 0.1 per cent accuracy or below for all redshift relevant to non-linear
structure formation. We use this description, in the first place, to
quantify the systematic errors induced by several approximations often
assumed in numerical simulations, including the typical set-up of the
initial conditions for massive neutrino cosmologies adopted in previous
works. We then take advantage of the flexibility of this approach to
rescale the late-time linear power spectra to the simulation initial
redshift, in order to be as consistent as possible with the dynamics of
the N-body code and the approximations it assumes. We implement our
method in a public code (REPS rescaled power spectra for initial
conditions with massive neutrinos https://github.com/matteozennaro/reps)
providing the initial displacements and velocities for cold dark matter

quantitatively address the impact of neutrinos on the (mildly
non-linear) spatial distribution of matter and in particular on the
neutral hydrogen distribution in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM), which
is responsible for the intervening Lyman-{$\alpha$} absorption in quasar
spectra. The free-streaming of neutrinos results in a (non-linear)
scale-dependent suppression of power spectrum of the total matter
distribution at scales probed by Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest data which is
larger than the linear theory prediction by about 25 \% and strongly
redshift dependent. By extracting a set of realistic mock quasar
spectra, we quantify the effect of neutrinos on the flux probability
distribution function and flux power spectrum. The differences in the
matter power spectra translate into a \textasciitilde{} 2.5\% (5\%) difference in the flux
power spectrum for neutrino masses with {$\Sigma$}m{$\nu$} = 0.3 eV
(0.6 eV). This rather small effect is difficult to detect from present
Lyman-{$\alpha$} forest data and nearly perfectly degenerate with the
overall amplitude of the matter power spectrum as characterised by
{$\sigma$}8. If the results of the numerical simulations are
normalized to have the same {$\sigma$}8 in the initial
conditions, then neutrinos produce a smaller suppression in the flux
power of about 3\% (5\%) for {$\Sigma$}m{$\nu$} = 0.6 eV (1.2 eV)

on neutrino masses using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey flux power

range of lower and upper bounds implied from the neutrino oscillation experiments and the cosmological constraints. To develop this model, we properly take into account relative differences between the density perturbation amplitudes of different components (radiation, baryon, CDM, and neutrinos) around the top-hat CDM overdensity region assuming the adiabatic initial conditions. Furthermore, we solve the linearized Boltzmann hierarchy equations to obtain time evolution of the linearized neutrino perturbations, yet including the effect of nonlinear
gravitational potential due to the nonlinear CDM and baryon
overdensities in the late stage. We find that the presence of massive neutrinos slows down the collapse of CDM (plus baryon) overdensity; however, the neutrinos cannot fully catch up with the nonlinear CDM perturbation due to its large free-streaming velocity for the ranges of neutrino masses and halo masses we consider. We find that, just like CDM models, the collapse time of CDM overdensity is well monitored by the linear theory extrapolated overdensity of CDM plus baryon perturbation, smoothed with a given halo mass scale, if taking into account the suppression effect of the massive neutrinos on the linear growth rate. Using these findings, we argue that the presence of massive neutrinos of mass scales 0.05 or 0.1 eV may cause a significant decrease in the abundance of massive halos compared to the model without the massive neutrinos, e.g., by 25\% or factor 2, respectively, for halos with 1015M{$\odot$} and at z=1.},

The dominant effect of neutrino mass is to lower the typical amplitude of density perturbations that eventually form halos, but for neutrino masses {$\greaterequivlnt$}0.4 eV the threshold for halo formation can be changed
significantly as well. We study the spherical collapse model for halo formation in cosmologies with neutrino masses in the range
m{$\nu$}i=0.05-1 eV and find that halo formation is differently sensitive to {$\Omega\nu$} and m{$\nu$}. That is,
different neutrino hierarchies with a common {$\Omega\nu$} are
in principle distinguishable. The added sensitivity to m{$\nu$} is small but potentially important for scenarios with heavier sterile neutrinos. Massive neutrinos cause the evolution of density
perturbations to be scale dependent at high redshift which complicates the usual mapping between the collapse threshold and halo abundance. We propose one way of handling this and compute the correction to the halo mass function within this framework. For {$\sum$}m{$\nu$}i{$\lessequivlnt$}0.3
eV, our prescription for the halo abundance is only {$\lessequivlnt$}15\% different than the standard calculation. However for larger neutrino masses the differences approach 50-100\% which, if verified by simulations, could alter neutrino mass constraints from cluster abundance.},

massive neutrinos as an extra set of particles, with total masses of
0.15, 0.30, and 0.60 eV, we investigate the impact of neutrino masses on
the spatial distribution of dark matter haloes and on the distribution
of galaxies within the haloes. We compute the bias between the spatial
distribution of dark matter haloes and the overall matter and cold dark
matter distributions using statistical tools such as the power spectrum
and the two-point correlation function. Overall we find a
scale-dependent bias on large scales for the cosmologies with massive
neutrinos. In particular, we find that the bias decreases with the
scale, being this effect more important for higher neutrino masses and
at high redshift. However, our results indicate that the
scale-dependence in the bias is reduced if the latter is computed with
respect to the cold dark matter distribution only. We find that the
value of the bias on large scales is reasonably well reproduced by the
Tinker fitting formula once the linear cold dark matter power spectrum
is used, instead of the total matter power spectrum. We also investigate
whether scale-dependent bias really comes from purely neutrino's effect
or from nonlinear gravitational collapse of haloes. For this purpose, we
address the {$\Omega\nu$}-{$\sigma$}8 degeneracy and
find that such degeneracy is not perfect, implying that neutrinos
imprint a slight scale dependence on the large-scale bias. Finally, by
using a simple halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, we investigate
the impact of massive neutrinos on the distribution of galaxies within
dark matter haloes. We use the main galaxy sample in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) II Data Release 7 to investigate if the small-scale
galaxy clustering alone can be used to discriminate among different
cosmological models with different neutrino masses. Our results suggest
that different choices of the HOD parameters can reproduce the
observational measurements relatively well, and we quantify the
difference between the values of the HOD parameters between massless and
massive neutrino cosmologies.},

of how to analyze large data sets best has recently received
considerable attention, and Karhunen-Lo\`eve eigenvalue methods
have been applied to both galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic microwave
background (CMB) maps. We present a comprehensive discussion of methods
for estimating cosmological parameters from large data sets, which
includes the previously published techniques as special cases. We show
that both the problem of estimating several parameters jointly and the
problem of not knowing the parameters a priori can be readily solved by
adding an extra singular value decomposition step.

It has recently been argued that the information content in a sky map
from a next-generation CMB satellite is sufficient to measure key
cosmological parameters (h, {$\Omega$}, {$\Lambda$}, etc.) to an accuracy of a
few percent or better--in principle. In practice, the data set is so
large that both a brute force likelihood analysis and a direct expansion
in signal-to-noise eigenmodes will be computationally unfeasible. We
argue that it is likely that a Karhunen-Lo\`eve approach can
nonetheless measure the parameters with close to maximal accuracy, if
preceded by an appropriate form of quadratic ``precompression.''

We also discuss practical issues regarding parameter estimation from
present and future galaxy redshift surveys and illustrate this with a
generalized eigenmode analysis of the IRAS 1.2 Jy survey optimized for
measuring {$\beta$} {$\equiv$} {$\Omega$}0.6/b using redshift space

Assuming only that the primordial perturbations were adiabatic, we use a covariance-matrix approach to estimate the precision with which these parameters can be determined by a CMB temperature map as a function of the fraction of sky mapped, the level of pixel noise, and the angular resolution. For example, with no prior information about any of the cosmological parameters, a full-sky CMB map with 0.5\textdegree{} angular resolution and a noise level of 15 {$\mu$}K per pixel can determine
{$\Omega$}, h, and {$\Lambda$} with standard errors of +/-0.1 or better, and

  abstract = {Clustering of dark matter halos has been shown to depend on halo 
properties beyond mass, such as halo concentration, a phenomenon
referred to as halo assembly bias. Standard halo-occupation models (HOD)
in large-scale structure studies assume that halo mass alone is
sufficient in characterizing the connection between galaxies and halos.
Modeling of galaxy clustering can face systematic effects if the number
of galaxies within a halo is correlated with other halo properties.
Using the Small MultiDark-Planck high-resolution N-body simulation and
the clustering measurements of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 main
galaxy sample, we investigate the extent to which the concentration
dependence of halo occupation can be constrained. Furthermore, we study
how allowing for the concentration dependence can improve our modeling
of galaxy clustering. Our constraints on HOD with assembly bias suggest
that satellite population is not correlated with halo concentration at
fixed halo mass. At fixed halo mass, our constraints favor lack of
correlation between the occupation of centrals and halo concentration in
the most luminous samples (M r {$<$} -21.5, -21),
and modest correlation in the M r {$<$} -20.5,
-20, -19.5 samples. We show that, in comparison with
abundance-matching mock catalogs, our findings suggest qualitatively
similar but modest levels of the impact of halo assembly bias on galaxy
clustering. The effect is only present in the central occupation and
becomes less significant in brighter galaxy samples. Furthermore, by
performing model comparison based on information criteria, we find that
in most cases, the standard mass-only HOD model is still favored by the
observations.},

  abstract = {The halo occupation distribution (HOD) describes the relation between 
galaxies and dark matter at the level of individual dark matter halos.
The properties of galaxies residing at the centers of halos differ from
those of satellite galaxies because of differences in their formation
histories. Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation and
a semianalytic (SA) galaxy formation model, we examine the separate
contributions of central and satellite galaxies to the HOD, more
specifically to the probability P(N|M) that a halo of virial mass M
contains N galaxies of a particular class. In agreement with earlier
results for dark matter subhalos, we find that the mean occupation
function M for galaxies above a baryonic mass
threshold can be approximated by a step function for central galaxies
plus a power law for satellites and that the distribution of satellite
numbers is close to Poisson at fixed halo mass. Since the number of
central galaxies is always zero or one, the width of P(N|M) is narrower
than a Poisson distribution at low N and approaches Poisson at high N.
For galaxy samples defined by different baryonic mass thresholds, there
is a nearly linear relation between the minimum halo mass
Mmin required to host a central galaxy and the mass
M1 at which an average halo hosts one satellite, with
M1\textasciitilde{}14Mmin (SPH) or M1\textasciitilde{}18Mmin
(SA). The stellar population age of central galaxies correlates with
halo mass, and this correlation explains much of the age dependence of
the galaxy HOD. The mean occupation number of young galaxies exhibits a
local minimum at M\textasciitilde{}10Mmin where halos are too massive to host
a young central galaxy but not massive enough to host satellites. Using
the SA model, we show that the conditional galaxy mass function at fixed
halo mass cannot be described by a Schechter function because central
galaxies produce a ``bump'' at high masses. We suggest parameterizations
for the HOD and the conditional luminosity function that can be used to
model observed galaxy clustering. Many of our predictions are in good
agreement with recent results inferred from clustering in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey.},
